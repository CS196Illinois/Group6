Summary:
The coordinate system is represented by a set of basis vectors(i hat and j hat). A different set of basis vectors can be used to create a new coordinate system that represent the same point.Each basis will have its own grid (or another way of looking at the same region). To convert between different coordinate systems, you need to use the change of basis matrix (multiply change of base matrix by vector). This converts a given vector from one base to another. To go the opposite direction, take the inverse of the change of basis matrix. The change of basis matrix is simple a set of vectors that describe the basis of the new coordinate system. 



If I have a vector sitting here in 2D spacewe have a standard way to describe it with coordinates.In this case, the vector has coordinates [3, 2],which means going from its tail to its tipinvolves moving 3 units to the right and 2 units up.Now, the more linear-algebra-oriented way to describe coordinatesis to think of each of these numbers as a scalara thing that stretches or squishes vectors.You think of that first coordinate as scaling i-hatthe vector with length 1, pointing to the rightwhile the second coordinate scales j-hatthe vector with length 1, pointing straight up.The tip to tail sum of those two scaled vectorsis what the coordinates are meant to describe.You can think of these two special vectorsas encapsulating all of the implicit assumptions of our coordinate system.The fact that the first number indicates rightward motionthat the second one indicates upward motionexactly how far unit of distances.All of that is tied up in the choice of i-hat and j-hatas the vectors which are scalar coordinates are meant to actually scale.Anyway to translate between vectors and sets of numbersis called a coordinate systemand the two special vectors, i-hat and j-hat, are called the basis vectorsof our standard coordinate system.What I'd like to talk about hereis the idea of using a different set of basis vectors.For example, let's say you have a friend, Jenniferwho uses a different set of basis vectors which I'll call b1 and b2Her first basis vector b1 points up into the right a little bitand her second vector b2 points left and upNow, take another look at that vector that I showed earlierThe one that you and I would describe using the coordinates [3, 2]using our basis vectors i-hat and j-hat.Jennifer would actually describe this vector with the coordinates [5/3, 1/3]What this means is that the particular way to get to that vectorusing her two basis vectorsis to scale b1 by 5/3, scale b2 by 1/3then add them both together.In a little bit, I'll show you how you could have figured out those two numbers 5/3 and1/3.In general, whenever Jennifer uses coordinates to describe a vectorshe thinks of her first coordinate as scaling b1the second coordinate is scaling b2and she adds the results.What she gets will typically be completely differentfrom the vector that you and I would think of as having those coordinates.To be a little more precise about the setup hereher first basis vector b1is something that we would describe with the coordinates [2, 1]and her second basis vector b2is something that we would describe as [-1, 1].But it's important to realize from her perspective in her systemthose vectors have coordinates [1, 0] and [0, 1]They are what define the meaning of the coordinates [1, 0] and [0, 1] in her world.So, in effect, we're speaking different languagesWe're all looking at the same vectors in spacebut Jennifer uses different words and numbers to describe them.Let me say a quick word about how I'm representing things herewhen I animate 2D spaceI typically use this square gridBut that grid is just a constructa way to visualize our coordinate systemand so it depends on our choice of basis.Space itself has no intrinsic grid.Jennifer might draw her own gridwhich would be an equally made-up constructmeant is nothing more than a visual toolto help follow the meaning of her coordinates.Her origin, though, would actually line up with ourssince everybody agrees on what the coordinates [0, 0] should mean.It's the thing that you getwhen you scale any vector by 0.But the direction of her axesand the spacing of her grid lineswill be different, depending on her choice of basis vectors.So, after all this is set upa pretty natural question to ask isHow we translate between coordinate systems?If, for example, Jennifer describes a vector with coordinates [-1, 2]what would that be in our coordinate system?How do you translate from her language to ours?Well, what our coordinates are sayingis that this vector is -1 b1 + 2 b2.And from our perspectiveb1 has coordinates [2, 1]and b2 has coordinates [-1, 1]So we can actually compute -1 b1 + 2 b2as they're represented in our coordinate systemAnd working this outyou get a vector with coordinates [-4, 1]So, that's how we would describe the vector that she thinks of as [-1, 2]This process here of scaling each of her basis vectorsby the corresponding coordinates of some vectorthen adding them togethermight feel somewhat familiarIt’s matrix-vector multiplicationwith a matrix whose columns represent Jennifer's basis vectors in our languageIn fact, once you understand matrix-vector multiplicationas applying a certain linear transformationsay, by watching what I've you to be the most important video in this series, chapter 3.There's a pretty intuitive way to think about what's going on here.A matrix whose columns represent Jennifer's basis vectorscan be thought of as a transformationthat moves our basis vectors, i-hat and j-hatthe things we think of when we say [1,0] and [0, 1]to Jennifer's basis vectorsthe things she thinks of when she says [1, 0] and [0, 1]To show how this workslet's walk through what it would meanto take the vector that we think of as having coordinates [-1, 2]and applying that transformation.Before the linear transformationwe’re thinking of this vectoras a certain linear combination of our basis vectors -1 x i-hat + 2 x j-hat.And the key feature of a linear transformationis that the resulting vector will be that same linear combinationbut of the new basis vectors-1 times the place where i-hat lands + 2 times the place where j-hat lands.So what this matrix doesis transformed our misconception of what Jennifer meansinto the actual vector that she's referring to.I remember that when I was first learning thisit always felt kind of backwards to me.Geometrically, this matrix transforms our grid into Jennifer's grid.But numerically, it's translating a vector described in her language to our language.What made it finally clicked for mewas thinking about how it takes our misconception of what Jennifer meansthe vector we get using the same coordinates but in our systemthen it transforms it into the vector that she really meant.What about going the other way around?In the example I used earlier this videowhen I have the vector with coordinates [3, 2] in our systemHow did I compute that it would have coordinates [5/3, 1/3] in Jennifer system?You start with that change of basis matrixthat translates Jennifer's language into oursthen you take its inverse.Remember, the inverse of a transformationis a new transformation that corresponds to playing that first one backwards.In practice, especially when you're working in more than two dimensionsyou'd use a computer to compute the matrix that actually represents this inverse.In this case, the inverse of the change of basis matrixthat has Jennifer's basis as its columnsends up working out to have columns [1/3, -1/3] and [1/3, 2/3]So, for exampleto see what the vector [3, 2] looks like in Jennifer's systemwe multiply this inverse change of basis matrix by the vector [3, 2]which works out to be [5/3, 1/3]So that, in a nutshellis how to translate the description of individual vectorsback and forth between coordinate systems.The matrix whose columns represent Jennifer's basis vectorsbut written in our coordinatestranslates vectors from her language into our language.And the inverse matrix does the opposite.But vectors aren't the only thing that we describe using coordinates.For this next partit's important that you're all comfortablerepresenting transformations with matricesand that you know how matrix multiplicationcorresponds to composing successive transformations.Definitely pause and take a look at chapters 3 and 4if any of that feels uneasy.Consider some linear transformationlike a 90°counterclockwise rotation.When you and I represent this with the matrixwe follow where the basis vectors i-hat and j-hat each go.i-hat ends up at the spot with coordinates [0, 1]and j-hat end up at the spot with coordinates [-1, 0]So those coordinates become the columns of our matrixbut this representationis heavily tied up in our choice of basis vectorsfrom the fact that we're following i-hat and j-hat in the first placeto the fact that we're recording their landing spotsin our own coordinate system.How would Jennifer describe this same 90°rotation of space?You might be tempted to justtranslate the columns of our rotation matrix into Jennifer's language.But that's not quite right.Those columns represent where our basis vectors i-hat and j-hat go.But the matrix that Jennifer wantsshould represent where her basis vectors landand it needs to describe those landing spots in her language.Here's a common way to think of how this is done.Start with any vector written in Jennifer's language.Rather than trying to follow what happens to it in terms of her languagefirst, we're going to translate it into our languageusing the change of basis matrixthe one whose columns represent her basis vectors in our language.This gives us the same vectorbut now written in our language.Then, apply the transformation matrix to what you getby multiplying it on the left.This tells us where that vector landsbut still in our language.So as a last stepapply the inverse change of basis matrixmultiplied on the left as usualto get the transformed vectorbut now in Jennifer's language.Since we could do thiswith any vector written in her languagefirst, applying the change of basisthen, the transformationthen, the inverse change of basisThat composition of three matricesgives us the transformation matrix in Jennifer's language.it takes in a vector of her languageand spits out the transformed version of that vector in her languageFor this specific examplewhen Jennifer's basis vectors look like [2, 1] and [-1, 1] in our languageand when the transformation is a 90°rotationthe product of these three matricesif you work through ithas columns [1/3, 5/3] and [-2/3, -1/3]So if Jennifer multiplies that matrixby the coordinates of a vector in her systemit will return the 90°rotated version of that vectorexpressed in her coordinate system.In general, whenever you see an expression like A^(-1) M Ait suggests a mathematical sort of empathy.That middle matrix represents a transformation of some kind, as you see itand the outer two matrices represent the empathy, the shift in perspectiveand the full matrix product represents that same transformationbut as someone else sees it.For those of you wondering why we care about alternate coordinate systemsthe next video on eigen vectors and eigen valueswill give a really important example of this.See you then!
