Welcome to an adventure of the mind it begins by looking ahead to the sights and sounds of the mechanical universe there are certain human activities that the mind associates with a particular place because it's somehow more special more elegant there for example I'm not inclined to gamble but if I wanted to I wouldn't go and play poker in some sleazy backroom I would take the Concorde to Monte Carlo put on my tuxedo and play roulette in the casino in the same way when I think of tennis I think of Wimbledon for horse-racing it's the Kentucky Derby for opera is La Scala and for physics if you want the study physics the place is Caltech that's what we're here for let's get started there is a branch of science cosmology it's called that concerns itself with the past present and future of the universe as a whole how did that universe begin how has it evolved and where is it going there is another branch of science in the realm of physics to be exact which is called mechanics the science of mechanics concerns itself with something not quite as philosophical perhaps but no less profound however it started and wherever it's going how does it all work [Music] from the smallest particle to the largest cluster of galaxies what keeps it all going whether it's speeding up slowing down changing direction or cruising straight ahead why does it all behave the way it does whether it's a solid a liquid or a gas or an enigmatic unseen force just how does it all interact and why all of these questions from the simplest to the most profound are by no means late arrivals in one form or another they've been around as long as there have been people to ask them even the earliest human inhabitants of this planet must have looked up at the sky and across the landscape and asked how does it all work and without even knowing it they had taken the first tentative steps to discovering and understanding the mechanical universe if there is a key to understanding the mechanical universe it can be found in the realm of mathematics and among early civilizations there were no greater mathematicians and the ancient Greeks the work of Greek mathematicians added immeasurably to the advancement of science in the area of circles for example they work to the point of exhaustion which is precisely what it took to find the number pi but despite or maybe because of such brilliant discoveries the Greeks fell behind once the Golden Age was over they placed a lower value on the questions than on the answers so with too few questions the world bought Aristotle's mechanics with Plato's ideas and eventually Ptolemy solar system in which the planets orbit the earth uniformly circles on perfect circles was held aloft by conventional wisdom answers instead of questions that went almost unchallenged well into the Renaissance.

[TEXT] 
The intellectual direction of Western civilization had fallen into line behind the endless circular argument of the photonic ideal the question isn't really why unless its why tamper with perfection the question is how how 1,500 years after Ptolemy was the perfect circle broken and in what must seem another contradiction of logic how did an orderly new world take shape in the crucible of scientific revolution it began when an extremely curious Polish monk Nicholas Copernicus looked toward the Stars and saw things in a different light among other things in the Copernican solar system the Earth orbits the Sun rather than the other way around why did Copernicus see the universe this way and from a scientific point of view how did such a vision make him the world's first revolutionary an intellectual bridge that had spanned thousands of years wave precariously in the winds of change pillars of an age-old academic community were beset with threatening questions no one was better equipped to fill the intellectual void and galileo galilei though Aristotelian thinking still ruled the world of the Italian Renaissance Galileo was an exception to the rule he was a Copernican with the courage of his convictions in other words he had the right idea at the wrong time fine said his critics an army which arose in defense of the status quo but if the earth really spins why does a ball drop from a tower in Pisa for example land directly below why not in the next city-state for a change the answers were more dangerous than the questions the church which considered him both the threat to Rome and an affront to common sense warned him to leave things in their proper places nonetheless in practice and theory Galileo spoke the truth and proved what seemed to be the impossible and when all was said and done [Music] [Applause] hopefully they'll hit the ground Galileo's findings are not only correct they come down through history as an amazing example of the scientific imagination at work with his brilliant mind set on explaining the universe in scientific terms Galileo's experiments led him to discover the law of inertia with uncanny physical insight and he accurately envisioned the parabolic paths of projectiles as well as the law of falling bodies even today when they come right down to it the questions behind these experiments are as challenging as they were three centuries ago how did Galileo calculate a projectiles path and by doing so how did he begin to propel mathematics deeply into the future in the days when seeing truly was believing how did he disprove the obvious perception about falling objects 

[TEXT]
How can a hammer and a feather land at the same moment and as Galileo himself fell from grace in 1633 why was the whole business of the universe a trial to everyone concerned about the same time every day was something of a trial to the wandering mathematician Johannes Kepler to a man in almost constant flight for his life a life of illness and poverty the loss of loved and loved ones witch-hunts and the even meaner spirits of his associates simple existence was something of a challenge surely no man ever sacrificed more to grasp the scientific truth but on the other hand no man's discoveries ever proved more rewarding and Kepler's laws the law of ellipses the law of equal areas and Kepler's third law of planetary motion the law of harmony with his laws of planetary motion as the key Kepler entered the secret chamber of the cosmos [Music] and yet by explaining how rather than why the solar system works he was destined to remain on the threshold of the mechanical universe it was time for someone else to come along and take the final step on this very path which led directly to the moon along came Isaac Newton with some crucial questions of his own why does an apple fall since an apple Falls why not the moon if an apple and the moon fall for the same reason why doesn't the moon like the Apple crash into the earth with such questions the questions of the life time Newton rather calmly sat down and piece by piece destroyed beyond repair the age-old machinery of the Aristotelian universe and then with answers that were equally astounding he created something to take its place the mechanical universe the mechanical universe a predictable orderly universe obeying precise mathematical laws and with the laws of motion the ability to take on almost any physical challenge with his laws of motion not unlike David confronting Goliath Isaac Newton took on the great issues of mechanics armed with his keen mastery of forces a precise knowledge of trajectories and the universal law of gravitation Newton mastered more than any human being before him and for that he deserves serious attention and considerable fanfare nonetheless in science answers are part of the past the future belongs to the questions that science raises which means that even Newton's laws were only a beginning in the right direction for example in modern times a projecto can be guided with mathematical precision how is that done part of the answer is an instrument called the gyroscope how does it work and in the all-encompassing mechanical universe why is even a bicycle wheel a kind of gyroscope angular momentum is a key to the answer 

[TEXT]
But what is angular momentum and why does it turn out to be so vital throughout the universe from the cutting edge of the most distant galaxies to whirlpools in the family baths angular momentum moves and all the best circles and among other things moving in circles is the key to keeping perfect time few things governed as steadily as today's mechanistic concern with time however while people now have more time on their hands the preoccupation with it is hardly a recent phenomenon what is comparatively recent however is the phenomenon of accurate time it came about gradually day in and day out for 4000 years it finally arrived with an understanding of harmonic motion what is harmonic motion and when it comes right down and up to it how does harmonic motion really work and going full circle in the mechanical universe how is it related to circular motion the answer isn't as mysterious as it may seem at first perception and there's no reason to approach it in a roundabout fashion however sometimes it helps [Music] all it takes is a little differential calculus while Isaac Newton's calculus goes far and wide throughout the mechanical universe the scope of his generosity was considerably more narrow Baron Wilhelm Gottfried von lightness strode the European landscape with the supreme confidence and a number of good reasons for it as a German diplomat and mathematician liveness was so successful that Voltaire characterized him as the epitome of optimism worldly outgoing quite a fellow with the ladies Leibniz had nothing in common with Newton except the discovery of the calculus there was plenty of room on Newton's plate for a little kindness after all he had created the laws of motion the law of universal gravitation the reflector telescope a theoretical explanation for light and Colour the menu of his unmatched accomplishments was extensive to say the least and yet despite so much intelligence Newton permitted if not encouraged a bitter controversy with Leibniz this episode only one of the emotional dramas in the mechanical universe threatened the reputation of one man and the sanity of another but it will also illustrate one of the curious paradoxes that lurk within the human heart of science for example while the scientist isn't always rational the scientific environment nearly always is in fact a physics laboratory is where nature reveals herself in the most rational terms compared to Newton what does the modern scientist really do beyond the well-intentioned textbook definition what's the method of science and in the real world how does the scientific method really work sometimes it begins with a small beaker of oil a sturdy iron pot a dash of Discipline a measure of creativity and perhaps a touch of genius and sometimes although very rarely the result is as significant as the value of the charge of the electron who was this physicist and by what painstaking means did he become one of the more famous men in scientific history past present and future physicists are forever fascinated by the mysteries of nature for example the mysterious nature of light 

[TEXT]
light the very idea has been as hard to grasp as the almost incomprehensible vastness of the universe and its speed has been even harder why does it have a specific value why is it called a fundamental constant and precisely what is a fundamental constant of nature henry cavendish knew the answer when he measured Newton's universal gravitational constant in the process of finding it Cavendish not only weighed the expanding British Empire he weighed the entire planet how in the world did he do that but not by hanging out in a pool these men live by laws that if not exactly legal are nonetheless well within the laws of classical mechanics of course not every man here fully appreciates that fact most walk down Chalky's narrow stairs to shoot a stick or to profit from the experience by some other means but odds are when certain laws of physics are applied just right every man here fully appreciates the effects [Music] the effects depend on the law of conservation of momentum and like the game of billiards it happened to originate in France in the early 17th century Rene Descartes grew up to love mathematics as the workings of God and as a philosopher he sought an explanation for all worldly phenomena in the process Descartes not only conceived the conservation of momentum he discovered analytic geometry with that discovery he changed forever the terrain of mathematics how by one vehicle or another do great scientific explorers approach unknown terrain and when something has been discovered already how can someone else sail right in and claim the credit whatever the science from electricity to mechanics credit sometimes goes not to the first to make a great discovery but to the last surely this was true in the case of James Prescott Joule who was far from the first to explore the realm of energy conservation he might have been the eighth or ninth scientists to come across the law of conservation of energy but like Columbus Joule got the credit for discovery why and in the greater scheme of things why does it really matter in the storehouse of the cosmos the shelves are as amply stocked with energy today as they were the morning the universe opened for business on the other hand if energy is never lost why do muscles get tired and why do masses fall mechanical energy like exercise in general has a lot to do with speed and position for a different perspective on changing positions catch the drift of the good ship Irish Coffee a challenge if there ever was one in the mechanical universe sophisticated electronics state-of-the-art tracking devices personnel beyond compare these are the resources of the United States Coast Guard also behind the scenes there are the tools of vector analysis in a crisis or a classroom how can vector mathematics go to the rescue [Music] in the serious world of science vector mathematics can accomplish miracles so the question is not whether it can come to this rescue but whether it really sure put another way is this music or is it Memorex in any case a classic Memorex commercial this clearly illustrates both excellent reproduction and the physical phenomenon of resonance listening to elephants what is resonances our it's many forms heard from throughout the mechanical universe and why does a mere human voice even one as powerful as Ella Fitzgerald's produce such shattering results and in the even greater atmosphere of the mechanical universe what are some other forms of sound and fury this trio undertook a journey that surpassed every earthly Explorer since the first primitive step into the unknown their destiny had be.

[SUMM]
The mechanical universe is a vast, mechanical universe with all kinds of different forms.  From the smallest particle to the largest cluster of galaxies we look at how does it all work. What keeps it all going whether it's speeding up slowing down changing direction or cruising straight ahead. Western civilization had fallen into line behind the endless circular argument of the photonic ideal. Galileo's findings are not only correct they come down through history as an amazing example of the scientific imagination at work. Johannes Kepler envisioned the parabolic paths of projectiles as well as the law of falling bodies. Kepler was destined to remain on the threshold of the mechanical universe. Isaac Newton destroyed the age-old machinery of the Aristotelian universe. All it takes is a little differential calculus while Newton's calculus goes far and wide throughout the mechanical universe.

Hello everybody and welcome. How is everybody today? Great. Well, I'm delighted to have the opportunity to be giving the DeVane Lectures. And the DeVane Lectures, as you can tell, from looking around you double as being a regular Yale course for credit that students can take for credit and lectures that are open to the general public. These lectures are going to deal with power and politics in today's world and by today's world, I'm gonna mean the 30 years since 1989 and the 30 years since 1989 are and have been an incredibly tumultuous period of very great change. And that's for xxx unusual. For instance, if you compare it to the previous 40 years in most of the advanced capitalist democracies, they were a period of relative stability after World War II. In most countries, it was an era of great prosperity even countries recovering from World War II like the countries of Europe were being rebuilt with Marshal Plan aid and it was a period, partly for demographic reasons, of very great political stability for people who grew up in that period. Internationally, as well, it was a period of very great stability because partly, because of the Cold War. It's true we had episodes like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War but as the Vietnam War indicates, most of the conflicts within the Cold War were played out as you like, as proxy wars in other parts of the world. From the point of view of the citizens of the Western democracies, except for those who are actually fighting in Vietnam, it was a far-off war that didn't have a great impact on the stability of people's lives and that is very different from what has been experienced since 1989; time, if you like, has speeded up a great deal. We've seen incredible change in three decades. And those are the three decades that I am going to be exploring. One pedagogical challenge that presents is that for some of us in this room, the last three decades are etched into our minds as like it was yesterday. We experienced them in real time but there are many people in this room who were never born until long after that. For them, whether it's the last 40 years or the last 60 years, 40 years or the 60 years after World War II, it's all history. One of the first things I need to do and I'm gonna try and make this a regular practice during the course is I need to take everybody back and to make people understand who weren't there what it was like and then to remind people who've lived through it of things that they might have forgotten. So let's just go back to 1989 in Berlin. - The Berlin Wall, once it divided East from West, now on its way to becoming an artifact of history. 

[TEXT]
(upbeat music) This the CBS Evening News. Dan Rather, reporting tonight from in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany. Good evening. These are the sights and sounds of the continuing celebration of Germans about the symbolic, not the literal, at least, not yet but the symbolic tearing down of the Berlin Wall. It's impossible to completely describe how deeply Germans feel about what's happened here. East German border guards tonight were literally tearing down portions of the wall itself, not the whole wall but portions of the wall to make it easier for East Germans to come into West Berlin and as the joyous hordes of Berliners were still streaming through the wall, the East German communist government said they can come and go permanently, they can come into West Berlin, have a look and then come back home again with no special documents required. Today, what goes through your mind and heart? - Well, of course, I look back to all those years of hardship for the families even more than for the country as a whole and it's moving to see families getting together again. My feeling is that we are very close to an end of the artificial division of Berlin and I also believe we are close to the point where the parts of Germany will become much closer together. This, of course, only within the reasonable European framework. Anyone know who that was? Xxx Billy Braun, the former Chancellor of Germany who actually would die a couple of years, three years after that, so he was one of the celebratory crowd at that time. So that might give you a little sense of the shock and the enthusiasm that people experienced in the latter days of 1989. This had been a period in which the Soviet Union was clearly losing its grip on Eastern Europe. It wasn't just Germany. Right across Eastern Europe, all through 1989, there had been these massive resistance movements developing and the Soviet Union was losing, it was clearly not in a position to intervene in these countries. And they were shedding totalitarian control for the first time in decades. Of course, the great exception which we will be talking about next week was in China where demonstrations in Tiananmen Square that June had come out, meant a very different result but in most of the world, after 1989, it seemed like democracy was on the March. We saw the democratization of all of the former Soviet Union bloc countries in Eastern Europe even places like South Africa which had been mired in a bitter conflict for decades transitioned in the early 1990s to a multi-racial democracy. The problems in Northern Ireland finally settled with the Good Friday Accords in 1997. Even Israel-Palestine which had been one of the most intractable conflicts for decades and decades seemed to be moving towards a resolution in the early 1990s. There were the Oslo Accords, the PLO and the Israeli government were negotiating a settlement. Anyone who was in Israel or the West Bank at that time anticipated that there was going to be a settlement until the assassination of one of the key protagonists, Yitzhak Rabin in November of 1995. And that would lead to an unraveling of that potential settlement but in the early 1990s, it's really I think difficult to overstate the enthusiasm for change. This is the period when Francis Fukuyama was talking about the end of history by which he meant that liberal democracy was sweeping the world. 

[TEXT]
In fact, at the turn of the 21st century, we finally went from a world in which most countries in the world were not democracies by most standard measures to a world in which most countries were democracies by most standard measures. So it's not surprising that one would have had the kind of enthusiasm that Fukuyama had at that time and that was almost, what's the word? Just snowballing across so much of the developed world. Enormous confidence in democratic capitalism and enormous confidence in the idea that many people were gonna be lifted out of poverty and that the world was heading for a kind of benign equilibrium, as an economist would say, Fukuyama's end of history idea. now let's fast-forward three decades and let's stay in Germany and here's a very different thing to look at. (speaking in foreign language) (audience cheering) (speaking in foreign language) So he's a leader of the Alternative for Deutschland, far-right anti-immigrant, anti-system political party and what he is celebrating is that they have crossed the 5% threshold. This is the AFP here on this graph. Germany has a 5% threshold to get seated in the parliament so if you don't get 5%, you get no seats, they hadn't gotten 5% before and now they had won 5% and so they saw themselves as getting a foothold in German electoral politics for the first time. Germany, in 2017 was coming out of a situation in which there had been a grand coalition between the SPD which is the left of said Social Democratic Party and the right of center CDU, Christian Democratic Party led by Angela Merkel. And the SPD were very unhappy, they had been in this grand coalition for a long time and they found that they were paying a huge price with their supporters. They were getting less and less of the vote for reasons we'll talk about later in the course and they announced that they were not gonna participate in a grand coalition again and they were gonna go into opposition and rebuild themselves. Angela Merkel then spent the next six months, Alternative for Deutschland were and still are seen as beyond the pale, nobody will form a government with them. So she spent the next six months trying to put together a coalition with the Green Environmentalist Party and the so-called Free Democrats. The Free Democrats would be what we would think of as, in this country, as Rand Paul libertarians. They are for small government, low regulation across the board. It's not surprising that she couldn't do it because the greens want green regulation. They want environmental regulation. That's their raison d'etre and the Free Democrats want no regulation or certainly, less regulation. So they stumbled along in and out of negotiations but they weren't able to form a coalition. However, over the course of that six months, all the opinion polls showed that the AFD, the Alternative for Deutschland was actually rising in popularity. And so the German president was very against having another election in the face of the stalemate with the Social Democrats refusing to join in a grand coalition on the one hand and Merkel's inability to construct a different coalition on the other. 

[TEXT]
They all knew that if they went for another election, the AFD would do even better. So finally, after much hand-wringing, the SPD was persuaded after extracting a very big set of concessions, including six ministries and the Finance Ministry. They were persuaded to go back into a grand coalition even though a lot of their membership didn't want it. So terrified were they of the prospect of another election in which the far right would do even better. So we thought German politics was kind of settling down at this point but the following year, this is what you see happening. - [Presnter] German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who's led Germany for 13 years has offered to step down as her party's leader and said she won't run for office again after her term ends in 2021. Her announcement came a day after her party, the Christian Democratic Union, saw a disappointing performance in a key regional election in the state of Hesse. The far-right, Alternative for Germany party claimed more than a dozen seats in Hesse's Parliament for the first time. The entire migrant party now controls seats in all 16 of Germany's state Parliament's plus the National Bundestag and European Parliament. - So there it is. They had also done very poorly in the Bavarian regional elections. They had hemorrhaged about 10% of their vote to the AFD in these regional elections and by the way, the SPD wasn't very happy either because they were hemorrhaging support to the greens. And this is something we'll see playing out in many European countries. The establishment parties are shrinking and becoming weaker and the parties on the fringes are growing and becoming stronger. And it was impossible not to start thinking about the past and thinking particularly about the 1920s and 30s. (speaking in foreign language) - [Presenter] As a result of the elections of July, 1932, the Nazis became the biggest party in Germany with 37% of the vote. - So if you wanna go back to the 1930s, you can see that that video was about the July 1932 election and you can see what happened in the subsequent elections that it was a very unstable system. They were having multiple elections and of course, 18 months later, Hitler came to power. And if you go to Germany, you hear very anxious people talking about is this back to the future? Is 2017 and 2018 some kind of replay of the empowerment of extremist parties and of course, it wasn't just Germany. In 2016 we had massive shocks delivered to establishment parties with the Brexit result in the UK and Donald Trump's populist stampede to the presidency in the US, both widely unanticipated outcomes by most of the establishment parties, pundits and politicians. 

[TEXT]
And you could go around the world. In the Austrian elections of 2016, people are very relieved that in the runoff, the Green candidate actually defeated the far-right quite handsomely by 54 to 46% but if you look at the legislature, again, you see the far-right gaining ground, the establishment parties coming in fourth and fifth in the 2017 legislative elections. These are the parties that would normally have come in first and second while the far-right party increased its vote, putting them a close third with 51 seats, while the Greens fell below the threshold and won nothing or if you look at Belgium, you see a center-right party retains its majority but if you drill down a little bit, you can see that there was an increase of support for the far-right Flemish Vlaams Belang which received almost 12% of the vote gaining seats. If you look at Italy, you can see the center-left party ceding power to the center-right but many of the votes for the center-right party are coming from the league, so-called, again, a far right-wing populist party which ends up with 125 seats and 17% of the popular vote, of 109 seats and I could put up another seven or eight or nine slides of different countries that basically tell the same stories in country after country across Europe both Eastern Europe and Western Europe, including countries that we thought of as bastions of civil social democratic stability like Sweden. You see these far-right parties doing well, Turkey, Latin America, elsewhere, where anti-establishment parties that sometimes also verge on being anti-system parties are gaining ground in many legislatures. So if you think about the contrast between the videos of 1989 and where the world has been since 2016, it couldn't be more dramatic and in some ways, it's a big downer but my first thing I wanna say is don't get too depressed. It's not all of course, for depression. The central questions of this course are three. How did we get from there to here? What are the challenges and prospects going forward? And most importantly, in the last part of the course, how could we get to a better place in many of the countries that we're talking about? We'll spend a lot of time on the US but not exclusively in the US. I should say a little bit about the distinctive approach that I'm gonna be taking in these lectures, not to say it's the best approach; there are many ways to look at this kind of material but it is the approach that I'm going to be using. And the first thing I would say about this approach is that I'm going to be studying history with the tools of political science and political theory on the one hand but also using history to keep political science and political theory honest. So what do I mean by that? Well, one thing that is remarkable about the events of 1989 is that they supply us with a terrific natural experiment from the point of view of social scientists. 

[TEXT]
If you look at the literature, for example, of people who studied European democracies, before 1989, they were essentially cycling endless numbers of theories through the same old data set that everybody had had for four decades. And they didn't have any a big exogenous change. 1989 is a big shock to the system and suddenly, we have, for instance, in Western Europe, in Eastern Europe, the addition of a whole lot of new parliamentary democracies. That creates possibilities of thinking about long-established conventional wisdom, testing theories against new data which is the gold standard for social science rather than testing theories on data out of which the theories have been developed, which tend to result in what statisticians call just-so stories, fitting the curve to the data. Suddenly we have all this new data, coming along in real time. If you think about and we're gonna talk some about some of the standard theories in political science like modernization theory, which is a theory about how as economies modify, certain kinds of political changes become more likely. It was long held that modernization produces democracy. There were many variants of modernization theory. And we will talk about some of the differences among them but now we have new data and whether modernizing economies will produce democracy. It is long been conventional wisdom that democratic systems are incompatible with state-run economies. If we look at what's happened since 1989, we've gone to market economies in some of the post-communist systems but others like China and Vietnam have become state capitalist systems of a certain kind while retaining non democratic politics. So we'll have cause to think about theories of that general sort. There's been a lot of conventional wisdom about the conditions for stable democracy that suddenly can be put to the test on a whole slew of new democracies. Is it all the economy stupid or do beliefs of citizens matter? And what kinds of beliefs matter and what about the beliefs of elites? All of these things, we can look at again, in new contexts. So we have lots of new data to think about them, provided by this dramatic break of 1989. There's a lot of conventional wisdom about the relations between business, government and labor that has built up among political economists and political scientists over the last several decades before 1989. We now have big power shifts partly because communism as an economic system has been taken off the table. Well if communism, as an economic system, is taken off the table, how does that restructure relations between business government and labor? It turns out it really has a big impact on those relationships. So that's another of the topics we will be looking at. How do electoral systems affect things like inequality, provision of environmental legislation and public goods? A lot of conventional wisdom there about which types of democracies are more likely to do that and which are less likely to do that start to look before and after 1989 and we're gonna discover that some of the conventional wisdom needs rethinking. So on the one hand we're bringing the tools of political science and the theories of political science to bear on the data that's thrown up by this last 30 years of history. 

[TEXT]
On the other hand, we're using that data to keep the political scientists honest, precisely because we have this whole smorgasbord of new results as a social scientist would put it but then I also said I'm gonna use the tools of political theory. So political theory, I should confess, truth in advertising by my first profession, if extended is a profession is I'm a political theorist. I cut my teeth in the world of political philosophy. I'm in normative things about what should happen, how the world should be organized, rather than empirical work on how it is organized. We are definitely gonna be thinking about normative questions here as well as we go along, what should happen, what might have happened but the confession I need to make about my home discipline is that it reminds me of the story about the fella who goes up to a farmer in Donegal and says how do I get to Dublin and the answer that comes back is well, I wouldn't start from here, sonny. That is to say much of political philosophy develops theories that take no account of where we actually are and how the theories that people argue about in the journals and in the literature actually could be implemented in the world, if at all. And this spills over into normative arguments made by other scholars. Thomas Piketty in his book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, argues for a 4% global wealth tax. Well, good luck with that. Who's gonna implement a 4% global wealth tax. So when I think about normative questions, it's gonna be from the perspective of how might the goals that we think are desirable actually be achieved. I am going to spend, as we go along, through the different topics that we're gonna be discussing. I am gonna be focusing on paths not taken, things that might have been done differently and here the sorts of things I'm gonna be talking about are things like NATO expansion, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the NATO alliance, we'll talk about this next week which was expanded over the next several decades to include most, eventually, all of the former Soviet bloc countries and there were overtures, also to including former Soviet states like Georgia and several others. I'll, talk about this Ukraine, Georgia and Ukraine were both talking about, joining NATO that part of the reason the Soviet Union invaded Ukraine. So we will talk about whether there was a path not taken at that time French president Francois Mitterrand thought that NATO should be shut down at the end of the Cold War it was a defensive alliance that had lost its purpose. How realistic was that? how might the world have been different had that happened we're going to be talking about the Global War on Terror I should in after 9/11 when, we invaded first Afghanistan and then Iraq. Was there another path that would have been politically viable that would have led the world in a different direction. 

[TEXT]
We will talk about the response to the financial crisis of 2008 in 2009, again what were their possibilities that, were, ignored or overlooked that might have been both politically feasible and more polished effective in the sense of policy and so that brings me to underscore the third feature of the approach that I am going to take in this course which is when you look at, people who talk about public policy, it tends either to be policy wonks who just go on about what would be, the best policy or political scientists who talk about why some policies get adopted in some systems and not in other systems but there's very little discussion of what is the effective political way of achieving a good policy or the effective political way of blocking a bad policy and so when I talk about innovations in the last part of the course, it's very much going to be in a way that marries considerations of politics to considerations of good public policy so, that that is the flavor of what we're going to be doing here and as I said it's not the only way one might study these materials ,but it's the way that we're going to be doing it in this course. Let me talk a little bit about the shape of the course. It falls into five, sections. The the first one is going to starting on Monday deal with the collapse of communism and its aftermath. There we going to look at collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in Russia, in China and in Vietnam. Although I will talk about some other countries along the way. We're going to talk about the rise of a unipolar world, until 1989, we had a bipolar world in which, as I said a lot of actual stability, that came about as a byproduct of the Cold War at least among the the major powers even if they maintained this stability, partly by, acting out their conflicts in proxy wars in, Asia, Africa and at America but it by and large the great powers were the nucleus standoff worked and we didn't have a major conflict between them. Now we have gone to a unipolar world dominated, by a single power ,after 1989. How does that restructure politics and the possibilities for politics that will be also part of our concern. And then I'm going to talk about the, politics of the economics. What I'm going to call the rise of neoliberalism at home and the Washington Consensus abroad and this is put on this is basically it comes to, exist because of the collapse of an alternative to capitalism, the disappearance of communism as a viable, political system as a viable economic system and so you have this idea that's often called neoliberalism that basically has three elements. Its trade deregulation, trade deals getting rid of restraints on trade, getting rid of internal regulation within countries, and massive privatization of formerly state assets that was called, the neoliberal approach to political public political economy. 


[TEXT]
And when it's translated into a set of recommendations or requirements for countries in the developing world, it was called the Washington Consensus, was essentially adopted by the World Bank by the IMF as a condition for giving loans to developing countries and it, was essentially taking neoliberalism global. And so the, post communist era is marked by, this massive confidence in, the the capacity of unregulated or mildly regulated free-market capitalism, to deliver the best results, for every country in the world then we're going to talk about the new global order, that is ushered in by this. We're going to look at whether democracy really was on the march the people thought about a potential we had talked again the conventional wisdom in political science was that the democratization had preceded in three waves. The first wave being the gradual expansion of the franchise in what we think of today as the older democracies, the second wave being decolonization in Africa and Asia and Latin America after World War II. The third wave coming in 1989 to 1991 and people started to wonder whether there's a fourth wave now with democratization of South Africa with settlements in places like Northern Ireland, initially with the Arab Spring people wondered whether we were going to start to see more democracy as part of this new global order. Then we're going to look at the international institutions that developed in this global order, we'll talk about things like, the International Criminal Court which for the first time would hold dictators to account for their activities of repression. There was the creation and of something called a doctrine at the United Nations called the responsibility to protect. Responsibility to protect, says that this was in the wake of, things like the Rwanda genocide of 1994 and what happened in Kosovo, in 1999 eventually we got responsibility to protect where the UN was said all governments are going to be held accountable for severe human rights violations within their own territories and if they don't respect them, the UN is going to intervene, militarily this is you know a big change we're saying we're not going to respect the sovereignty of Nations so the new international order seems to be, affecting not only relations among countries but relations within them. The third part of the course I'm calling the end of the end of history and this is really, has its ultimate roots with 9/11 and the emergence of the global war on terror. The invasion of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and eventually the collapsing Syria we're going to see that the idea that history was heading in some benign direction, was getting harder and harder for people to hold on to. 

[TEXT]
we're going to look at the resurgence of state capitalism. we're going to look at what China was, has been and is doing in Africa. We are going to be looking at Russia's resurgence as a global power, they had been back on their heels, for much of the 1990s and early 2000 but now they became actively involved, in, the Middle East and elsewhere, we're going to, look at, the new role of business in many political conflicts around the world sometimes with benign purposes in mind, but often not and so we're going to start to see a much messier politics. The fourth part of the course, is about the new politics of insecurity. This is really ushered in not so much by the financial crisis itself, but by the way in which governments responded to the financial crisis and this will be one of the areas where we will be looking at paths not taken but, we will see that there was, growing insecurity in the workforces of many of the advanced democracies that had been building up for decades, and the financial crisis, threw into sharp relief the fact that most governments were not doing much about it if anything at all and in fact that they ended up bailing out the elites, while doing nothing much, for the people who have been most harmed in the crisis and so we will look at the response to, the financial crisis in a number of countries particularly in the US and then we will all in the last part of the course, what is to be done that great Leninists slogan, we will be looking at, two things really. First how the, voter sentiment in these countries was, so poorly misdiagnosed by so many, political elites and people in control of political parties, misdiagnosed to the point where not only did they fail to respond, to the growing economic insecurity, that was experienced by many, many millions of workers within their own countries. They were actually implementing political reforms that were likely to make things worse. And so the last part of the course will be looking at those two interacting issues. What sorts of economic policies were pursued or failed to be pursued. What kinds of policies might have been pursued and how did the reform of political systems over the last 15 or 20 years, make the problem worse and that will lead me, to make some arguments, about how we should, think about, politics going forward. So, that is what we're going, to be doing. It's a big menu, we have, you know we have 26 now soon to be 25 lectures in which to explore it. I'm going to, before breaking today, I'm going to talk about a few logistical matters. One is that I have been asked to announce but you can see for yourself, that the Office of Public Affairs is, taking pictures and these lectures are going to be videotaped. And this will include, we will have microphones so we can have questions from the floor and interaction but you should know that, this is all being tape recorded and so anything you say can be taken down and used in evidence against you. 

[TEXT]
So, a couple of other logistical things. One is I want to introduce Christina Seyfreid. Christina, she's the head teaching fellow for the course so for she will be overseeing the grading of students who are taking the course, for, credit and she will also be working with me, in, running office hours for people from the community, which we're both going to be doing. I'll say a little bit more about that in a minute but, you will see more of Christina as we go along. Office hours I'm gonna be having office hours in Rosenkranz room 201 from 10:00 to 12:00 on Wednesdays and Fridays. The presumption there is that from 10:00 to 12:00, Yale students have priority. These are walk-in office hours not by appointment and on 10:00 to 12:00 on Fridays, people from the community have priority but who knows if anyone will show up but that's the way it'll work 201 Rosenkranz Hall which is right opposite, the new colleges up the street. Christina is going to have office hours for people from the community on Thursdays, from 5:00 to 7:00 at a place yet to be announced and one thing we're going to do, the office hours are not just going to vanish into the ether we're going to, Christina and I are going to film five sessions over the course of the semester, where she and I will discuss what's come up in the office hours and we will post that, on the course website. I do this with my Coursera course and it proves to be quite helpful. So, we will get questions that have come up in the office hours both in our office hours and in office hours, between the students and the Teaching Fellows, that they will be participating as well and we will publish those videos of the office hours on the course website. Access to reading. Anyone who has a Yale ID can get almost all of the readings on Canvas, there's a few, I think three of the book, we're using too much for copyright reasons to put them on Canvas but they're all in the library for anyone who doesn't want to buy any. The, people from the community we have, made available in the New Haven Public Library if you don't have access to Canvas us a couple of sets, of the books that we're being using in the course or you can get them that way. Those who are taking, the students who are taking the course for credit the official exam is the last afternoon of the last day of exams, which I'm sure some of you have already bought plane tickets that are, inconsistent with that. So actually we're going to have to alternate exams. One on December 11th and this is primarily to accommodate SOM students because, of the timing of the SOM elective, exam period and that exam will, if we can arrange it be held at SOM, and then there'll be, but others can take it then as well if they want. And then there'll be an another alternate exam on Friday the 13th so there'll be different times at which people can take the exam. Policy here will be no laptops, no screens, no iPhones. I came to this policy a couple of years ago. 

[TEXT]
It definitely works better. It's just too tempting to be doing that Amazon shopping for your grandmother's birthday present that you forgot about and it's very distracting not only for the people around you but it's also distracting for me, to teach. We will post the slides on Canvas and on the course web page off the lectures so people will have access, to the slides. What you'll find is if you go and you look at the slides on Canvas, they'll look like they'd been turned into a PDF and the video will not play. If you want to play the video, you have to download the slides and then it will read, it will regurgitate as playable videos, so it is possible to play the video, yes so no laptops, no screens, no phones and everything, everything I put up here will be available to you, so you don't have to take copious notes of what appears on slides. Comments, questions. Yes, sir, you're gonna have to yell. We will have microphones here starting next time. (student speaking faintly) You can't. So that's why we put a set of the reasonings in a New Haven library and the reason for it, it's not just Yale being mean. It turns out there're two sets of copyright rules so if you are photocopying chapters from a book, you are allowed to take up to 10% of the book, otherwise you have to buy the book if you're using it but universities, for their students, have a more permissive rule. So we can take more than 10% from a book. I've forgotten what the exact number is but it's much more than 10%. We can take more than 10% from a book and put it up on Canvas if it's only available to Yale students but if we made them available to the general public, Yale would be violating copyright laws. So that's why we have bought two complete sets of the books and put them in a New Haven Public Library, from which we have been xeroxing most of this stuff. So you should be able to get the vast majority of the readings if you wanna go down there and get them. Other questions, comments, observations? If there's a question in your mind, it's probably in the mind of 30 other people so they'll be grateful if you ask it. Yeah, you just have to yell. (student speaking faintly) Are we gonna look at the European Union as well as what? (student speaking faintly) We're certainly gonna look at the growth of the European Union and the expansion of the European Union since, in fact, we're gonna talk about it next class. We're gonna look at the expansion of the European Union since the Cold War. I'll talk very briefly about the early, this course is really post 1989. We've just hired David Engerman and Arne Westad, who are both cold war historians who are gonna be teaching courses on the Cold War. 

[TEXT]
So if you really wanna deal with the post-war Europe from into war Europe II to the end of the Cold War, these are the guys who are gonna be teaching that stuff going forward in Yale College. So I'm very consciously not doing that. So I will talk about the way in which the European Union was formed which has had a lot to do with its current troubles but mostly, I'm gonna focus on since 1989. Yeah, pardon? (student speaking faintly) There are no sections in this course. This is why we have an hour and a quarter lecture rather than a 50-minute lecture. Yeah. (student speaking faintly) The topics for the papers will be posted two weeks before the papers are due and we will give, I should say a couple of things about that. This is not a research course so you can write a first-rate paper based on reading the material on this syllabus. You are not expected to go beyond the syllabus. And we will post, two weeks before the papers are due, a list of topics of and it will be, there will be very significant amount of choice on it so we'll probably give you four or five possible topics to write about. Yes, sir. What is the expectation for graduate students? The same course requirements, two papers and a final exam. Yeah. Yes, sir. Pardon. - [Student] Is there a limit for (mumbles) students to join the class? - No, there's no limit. This is an uncapped course. I'm hoping we can stay in this room, it looks like it. Numbers tend to go down rather than up during shopping period. It's not a capped course. Yeah. (student speaking faintly) People have taken courses with me before know that I have a pretty interactive lecturing style. So yes, there will be microphones and there will be questions. I'm not planning to talk for an hour and a quarter every Tuesday and Thursday. So there will be significant amount of interaction. Yes sir. (student speaking faintly) Yeah, we currently, I believe, have six in addition to Christina's Teaching Fellows, all of whom will be holding office hours. They'll be available and you will be able to go and talk to them about what's come up in the class, about your papers and so on. And the conversations you have with those teaching fellows, we will also address then in the videotaped office hours that we post. Okay. So any other questions, comments, reactions? So on Tuesday, we're gonna talk about the collapse of the Soviet Union from Soviet Communism to Russian gangster capitalism. I will see you then. (music)

[SUMM]
Enormous confidence in democratic capitalism and enormous confidence in the idea that many people were gonna be lifted out of poverty and that the world was heading for a kind of benign equilibrium, as an economist would say, Fukuyama's end of history idea. Was there another path that would have been politically viable that would have led the world in a different direction. These lectures deal with power and politics in today's world and by today's world, I'm gonna mean the 30 years since 1989 and the 30 years since 1989 are and have been an incredibly tumultuous period of very great change.

Good evening and welcome my name is Rick Mulaney I'm the director of the Public Policy Institute here at Jacksonville University and welcome to the fourth annual Hesburgh lecture we're very pleased to have all of you here the Public Policy Institute in partnership with the Notre Dame Club of Greater Jacksonville has been hosting this lecture series for four years and we are very pleased to here at Jacksonville University and I will tell you in the past we've had some outstanding lectures but quite frankly I think tonight's will be the best yet and it is certainly the most timely as everyone knows the President Barack Obama was here in Jacksonville today the Republican nominee for president Donald Trump was in Jacksonville today and on Tuesday five days from now there'll be an election in which the ballot the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance very important topic and that's the one we have for tonight it's a great topic and hope you're going to enjoy tonight's discussion before we get to that discussion this lecture series wouldn't exist except for Pacquiao bein as y'all if you know he's the president of the Notre Dame Club of Greater Jacksonville and so Pat came together and we put together this lecture series we think it's a great a great annual event and it just so happens when he was in law school at Notre Dame he had professor Barrett as his teacher so not only see the president of the club the person responsible for putting this together he was a student in her class he is the perfect person to introduce our tonight's special speaker so I'd like to introduce Pat Kilbane it is it's always fun to do an introduction when you don't even need a paper or notes to introduce the person but you I want to make sure I don't leave anything out but and it's really fun to see professor Barrett when a three-hour exam is not gonna follow my visit with her so professor amy coney barrett is the diane and mo miller research chair and law she received her undergraduate degree from Rhodes College in Memphis Tennessee where she received that degree magna laude in English literature and then she received her Juris Doctorate degree from the University of Notre Dame summa laude where she won the horns prize and to translate that that means that she was the top graduate in her class and going from Notre Dame she went to clerk for justice Lauren Silverman on the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and then that she chased that with clerking for the late Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court Antonin Scalia following her work with Justice Scalia she worked at the Miller Cassady law firm in Washington DC where she had a litigation practice at the trial and appellate level she did appellate work also professor Barrett's scholarship focuses on statutory interpretation constitutional law federal courts and in fact she was appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts of the United States Supreme Court to the Advisory Committee for the federal rules of appellate procedure 

[TEXT]
she's she's one of those professors I actually had her for two classes she doesn't remember I had to remind her when we were setting this up but she she's she's that professor who's elected year after year by her students to give the commencement addresses to be the who receives the award for being the outstanding professor so it's it's truly a blessing to have her here especially as Rick said during this timely season where one of the major issues for many voters especially me is which one of these candidates is going to get to appoint Supreme Court justices so I can't wait to hear her take on that and lastly professor Barrett makes her home with her Notre Dame Ella's alum husband Jesse in South Bend with their seven children so professor Barrett welcome to Jacksonville a little bit about Justice Scalia and what his absence from the court will mean and then shift and talk in a broader brush about what's coming for the court and what the election will mean for the court and I know I have a room that's mixed some lawyers and some not so if the lawyers will forgive me out I'm going to try to pitch it so that the non lawyer can follow along as well justice scalia's it's hard to overstate the influence that he had on the court and the whole that will be gone with his passing yes Justice Scalia was a conservative and so you know it's often said he was on the conservative wing of the court but it I really dislike the use of that word in this context and he would too translated to say that he was a conservative doesn't refer to partisan politics to say in the context of constitutional law that Justice Scalia was a conservative described his approach to the Constitution and has approached to the judicial rule not a party affiliation Justice Scalia's approach to interpretation of both the Constitution and statutes and that's the grist for the mill for a federal judge as interpreting federal statutes and the Constitution his approach very much emphasized the primacy of the text his view was that you're talking about the Constitution as a text that the Constitution means what it meant to those who ratified it as people would have under he interpreted the text as people would have understood that text at the time it was ratified so for the original Constitution we're looking at the late 18th century understandings for the Civil Rights amendments we're looking at the post Civil War Reconstruction period understandings but his rationale for that was depth democracy that this is the enacted text it went through the process of ratification or a constitutional amendment to become a law and if we change the law now to comport with our current understandings or what we wanted to mean then it sees to be the law that has democratic legitimacy so he believed that change should come from the democratic process that changed from the Constitution should come through constitutional amendment and statutory change should come from Congress or state legislatures that the Constitution didn't call all the shots that change and social change the Constitution set a floor below which we can't go but that above that floor there's a lot of room for democracy for the people to add additional protections and to make changes 

[TEXT]
so Justice Scalia resisted the notion that the Supreme Court should be in the business of imposing its views of social mores on the American people he thought that things that the Constitution didn't declare off limits were up to the people to decide his view of this emphasis on text and the emphasis on textual meaning as it was understood at the time of its ratification in the context of the Constitution or statutory enactment in the context of legislation distinguish him from those we might characterize as the Liberals on the court and I give the same caveat here we're not talking about partisan politics we're talking about the word liberal capturing an approach to constitutional interpretation and that approach which Justice Breyer Justice Stephen Breyer is a good example of it Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer went out on the talking circuit and they often sparred about the approaches to constitutional interpretation so justice Breyers approach is much more pragmatic so he starts with the text of a statute or a constitutional provision he begins with the text but as Justice Breyer describes it the text is a starting point but not an ending point and sometimes it makes sense to push the text in a different direction in a way that makes sense to the judge that the judge will think leads to a more sensible result so that's kind of a nutshell version of the living Constitution approach and it stands in Contra distinction to the original ISM or textualism of Justice Scalia Justice Scalia was an extraordinarily effective advocate for his approach to interpretation because he was very smart and had an outsized personality he really was brilliant it was intimidating working for him you know when he called you in his office you had to be prepared to just go to the mat and talk about whatever it was and he was always five steps ahead of you so he had a intellect but then he didn't express that intellect only to lawyers it wasn't just in the United States reports and judicial opinions he wrote books that were accessible to popular audiences he went out and gave speeches and so he made his ideas and his approach to the constitution and his ideas about the judicial role accessible to non lawyers he wants remarks that the reason why he wrote dissents and separate opinions concurrences is because he wanted to get them in the case books and he was a colorful writer he was an excellent writer and so casebook authors would include his dissents and separate opinions because they were so engaging and so clear and then that influenced law students who read them so his influence on generations of law students has been great and his influence on the public debate has been great so the significance of his seat it's it's an empty seat on the court and it has the potential to flip the balance on the court between these two camps of judges judges who take a more expansive approach to Constitution and judges who take a more textual approach to the Constitution 

[TEXT]
but the symbolic significance is that it's his seat so he is the face really and he is the face of this originalist text analyst textualist approach to the Constitution and so if President Obama had successfully and I think at this point it's unlikely that President Obama will be the one to name the successor to Scalia's seat but if Hillary Clinton or President Obama names the successor to that seat it's not just that it was held by a conservative justice one who took this more conservative approach to the judicial role but that it was Justice Scalia so the symbolic nature of that flip would be significant I want to talk a little bit more broadly about what the election means for the composition of the court more generally Justice Scalia's seat is getting all the attention because it's the one that stands vacant but the reality is that the next president will likely get four appointments Justice Scalia's seat is empty Justice Ginsburg is 83 Justice Breyer Rick help Maisie 79 78 78 and Who am I Oh Justice Kennedy is 80 so that's four seats that's the last president who got four nominations was Nixon so this could be a sea change now you're talking about Justice Scalia who took this very kind of rigorous textual approach Justice Kennedy is a fellow traveler of the courts textualist in statutory cases not always in constitutional cases he's obviously the notorious swing vote in constitutional cases but he's a he's a swing vote he can go either way Ginsburg and Breyer are much more firmly in the camp of the more expansive approach to constitutional interpretation so let's imagine President Clinton if she replaces Ginsburg and Breyer she will do so with much much much younger justices who then will likely have a very long tenure in the court in front of them okay that will be quite significant to the court if she replaces Justice Kennedy with a pick it's going to be someone who I mean Justice Kennedy is a swing vote sometimes he votes with a more conservative wing of the court sometimes with the more liberal wing of the court and again I'm using those turns and they're sent in their interpretive sense rather than their partisan sense um but Hillary Clinton would not appoint someone who would be a swing in those cases it would be someone who was always very firmly on the side of those who interpret the Constitution more expansively so we would be talking aver about a very market shift it would be a very Court that was very very liberal and took a very expansive view of the judicial role what would we have in a trump court who knows I think we know for sure I could say with confidence I don't know who Hillary Clinton would appoint but I can say with confidence the profile or the kind of constitutional approach she would want Trump I'm not so sure he's offered a list in his list is populated with people who would take a more Scalia esque approach to the Constitution who knows if he would choose from that list or not is obviously not bound to do so I think it would be maybe more of a mixed bag 

[TEXT]
I think maybe Trump would appoint some that were more in the mold of Scalia maybe some more in the mold of Kennedy who knows I think we may well end up with a moderate to more conservative court on judicial role I think it is safe to say it probably wouldn't be as hard to the the left-leaning side on the approach to constitutional questions as as Hillary would before Rick and I start you know the next segment the final thing I want to say about this this question of partisan politics and the court is that Justice Scalia thought it was so important and if voters could really absorb it's hard because voters and people generally see the headlines in newspapers you know court decides in favor of same-sex marriage or you know court strikes down Texas abortion restrictions it's just the headline it's just the bottom line it doesn't show any of the reasoning and the hard analysis that the court goes through to reach that decision and I think it leaves voters with the impression that justices and judges are just casting votes based on the policy results that they prefer you know I'm I'm pro-life or I'm Pro same-sex marriage or what-have-you whatever the the hot issue is on the court that term but that is not how judges see their role it is certainly not how Justice Scalia saw his and one there are a couple of really stark examples of this that I think show in Justice Scalia's case the divergence between partisan politics or political preferences and adherence to the rule of law and to me that's the quality that we should be looking at when we think about what justices would fill these vacant and soon-to-be vacant spots on the court Justice Scalia before he was on the court was in the Reagan administration he was in he was a in a law-and-order Republican administration that was tough on crime and as you know in his former life as a Republican and the department of jennife Ischl in the republican department of justice i'm assuming that his personal preferences may have leaned more to the law-and-order side but he was one of the most consistently Pro criminal defendant justices in constitutional Criminal Procedure cases because he thought the text of the Constitution required it and so he was constantly voting with the quote kind of more liberal justices in cases interpreting the sixth amendments right to confront witnesses in interpreting the Fourth Amendment search and seizure Clause interpreting the extent of the jury trial right and sentencing because he thought you went where the law took you you followed the rule of law not your partisan preference an example that was close to his heart was Texas versus Johnson which was a flag burning case Justice Scalia um and I I think I heard someone describe this once as something that would be difficult for someone not in his generation to fully understand the gravity of it I'm Texas versus Johnson involved a case challenging state law Texas law that made it illegal to desecrate the flag 

[TEXT]
many states had such laws and you know Johnson in this case had desecrated the flag Justice Scalia voted with those justices who hold that he had a First Amendment right of free speech to desecrate the flag that was very painful for Justice Scalia and and to me not that I would desecrate the flag but I think not what I've what my grandfather said who was a World War 2 veteran was that you just can't understand the deep significance of the pain that it wasn't just wow I don't like that result but kind of the emotional wrenching that it was to cast a vote for a result that he really found painful that he abhorred but he thought that's what the First Amendment required and I think those examples really show what we want an injustice someone who applies the law who follows the law where it goes and doesn't decide simply on the basis of partisan preference Rick I know you had some questions that you wanted to present presser Barrett I like to put this a little bit of a historical context we had a chance to trap to talk yesterday and we'll talk a little bit about the arc of history because something you said yesterday was really striking I want to put with five days the next five days what happens on Tuesday means to the future of the country in the future of these decisions not by looking for just yet but by looking backward one of the things you said I'd like for you to comment on yesterday was that the last time there was a liberal majority was during the Nixon administration so can we look back a little bit over the last sort of 40 years and sort of describe the composition of the court and then describe what's at stake next Tuesday sure um Nixon got four appointments now it's a little bit so a lot of people say well the last president who could really shape you know the last time we had a majority of Democratic appointees on the court was prior to Nixon okay which is true Nixon had four pointees it's a little bit difficult to say because and this has been particularly two of Republican appointed justices they haven't always turned out to take a conservative approach or take kind of a very text-based approach to the Constitution right so included in justice Stevens was a Ford appointee but he was a Republican appointee but he was very much in the camp of the the more expansive judicial role type judges Blackmun Nixon appointee so he was a Republican appointee justice Souter was a you know George HW Bush appointee but timed his resignation so that President Obama would get the appointment because justice Souter was also very much more kind of an expansive judicial role so it's it's not always easy to say do we have a primarily conservative or liberal Court simply by looking at who whether the majority of the sitting justices were appointed by Republicans or Democrats I think that with the Nixon appointments there was definitely a move in the court and Carter didn't get any and then when you see Reagan come in that's where you had the real definitive shift that's where you got justice O'Connor Justice Kennedy Justice Scalia you had a conservative majority you had an active and energized conservative majority on the court 

[TEXT]
Justice Thomas was then appointed by George HW Bush and justice Souter that was you know Justice Scalia one on the court in 1986 so I think in those years before Rehnquist was appointed by Ford and that was also kind of a push towards the more restrictive judicial role type Court but you really had it kind of decisively accomplished in the Reagan years so you're looking for 1986 to the present that that's at least we're talking to a pretty healthy stretcher we're looking at least 20 years I think it's also important to recognize that part of what Nixon was getting at Nixon promised to appoint strict constructionists you know judges that would really enforce the Constitution as written and by the way Justice Scalia would roll over in his grave if he heard anyone describe him as a strict constructionist because his view was that you know an interpret the text strictly you don't interpret it expansively ughter prett it at the level of generality with which it is written but strict constructionism was a term that got thrown around a lot because it was a reaction to the Warren Court so the Warren Court had been very active it had really been V living constitutionalism Court before that this idea of a living Constitution really wasn't around and so when Nixon came in and said he wanted to change the court it was in response to what a lot of people saw at the time as a court run amok that the Warren Court was inventing all of these rights in broad terms some come in some commentators talked about sort of the arc of the court that from the FDR and Harry Truman yeah but it certainly was liberal for many decades that a transition started with President Nixon and as you've mentioned for probably at least three decades going back to 1986 and maybe beyond you've pretty much had more or less that you could say a conservative majority is that a fair state I'd like to talk about what's happening next Tuesday you mentioned earlier something that I think is really true I mean I the focus of the nation tends to be on the replacement of Scalia because that's the 5-4 tiebreaker but what's being missed as you mentioned I'd like you to comment on the most two things not only the ages of the three older justices Ginsburg Kennedy and Breyer but how youthful the more liberal judges are Kagan at 56 and Sotomayor at 62 meaning that isn't it very possible you could have a liberal majority for the next couple decades and Beyond based on what happens next Tuesday absolutely and I mean I think that I think one reason so there's a lot of speculation and I don't have a crystal ball so I don't know if Hillary Clinton wins whether she would stay with Merrick garland or choose someone else

but I suspect she would choose someone else for youth because a president can shape the court Merrick garland is in his 60s 61 62 I think in his early 60s a president has a bigger impact on the court the longer the justice he or she appoints stays in office and Merrick garland I think I read an analysis by a former Supreme Court Clerk who's a Democratic policy adviser he said oh no no no no she should just focus on getting through controversial legislation in Congress and not fight the garland nomination battle because he will do everything she wants him to do he will be solidly reliable in every high-stakes constitutional case because he would take this approach that the Constitution should translate into kind of Prudential judgments by justices I don't know if she would or not because even if Merrick garland who is by all accounts a wonderful man and an excellent judge even if he would be reliable and shares her judicial shares her judicial philosophy and a lot of these high-stakes questions he doesn't excite many parts of the base he's he's a little boring in that respect so she would have an opportunity to energize her base and to put in someone who is much younger and then absolutely Rick you have a pretty long living court you know Justice Scalia was on the court for almost 30 years and he was appointed in his early 50s so it could represent a significant change over the last several decades and to give that a little bit of meaning what I'd like to do is is to ask you a question that arises from the third presidential debate Chris Wallace asked this question which I think relates to how you select judges and what it might mean in the third presidential debate you may remember Chris Wallace asks each candidate what criteria are you looking for when you go to pick the next Justice I'm giving you a real shorthand of a couple of the answers Hillary Clinton mentioned she wanted someone who protected individual rights and minority rights Donald Trump mentioned he wanted somebody pro-life either of these court of course a very Scalia like and so I'd like you to comment on that versus the selection criteria based on your views of constitutional law professor as to what we're looking for in the US Supreme Court justice um those kinds of answers are I think what's wrong with our nomination process to say I want to appoint someone who's pro-life or I want to appoint someone whose primary focus is protecting minority rights though the candidates are talking to their bases and talking to the electric and saying signal I'm going to put people on the court who share your policy preferences was saying before I think that's not the right qualification for a justice I mean we shouldn't be putting people on the court that share our policy preferences we should be putting people on the court who want to apply the Constitution and by the way on the on the individual rights of the minority rights when the Constitution demands that minority rights be protected that's what we want justices to do that's their job 

[TEXT]
I tell I you x' the example with my constitutional law students of Odysseus words resisting the sirens but the Constitution is like in Odysseus ties himself to the mass to resist the song of the sirens he tells his crew don't untie me no matter how much I plead that's what we've done as the American people with the Constitution we've said you know it's the people sober appealing to the people drunk that when you are tempted to get carried away with by your passions and trample upon the First Amendment rights or minority rights this document will hold you back and it's the job of the justices of judges generally but then ultimately the Supreme Court for the exercise of judicial review to tell us like in the flag-burning case we understand you people you American citizens that you want to protect your flag but you've made a more fundamental commitment to free speech that ties your hands and you can't do so that's what it's about it's not about I like flag desecration I don't like flag desecration it's about are you going to enforce the limits that are there but then if the people do something you don't like if it's not one of those situations where the the hands are tied or just yes it's tied to the mast that you have the courage and integrity to say I'm not going to interfere in the democratic process if the Constitution doesn't restrict your ability to do electorate what you've decided to do in this particular statute you've enacted then I'm going to not interfere I will resist the temptation as a judge to impose my preferences on you and say that you are limited in the policies that you want to pursue this is an aside Justice Roberts in his confirmation you talked about the role of being an umpire and I guess if you were an umpire you couldn't be pulling for the Cubs or the or the Indians last night you just had to call it ball or a strike regardless of your policy preference as to how that game turned out but I would like to bring up a case that illustrates the difference of a more expansive view versus a a textual view I almost said strict construction excuse me more originalist view and this is a case and this is not about the merits of the policy so I want to lay aside whether or not you're in favor of same-sex marriage or opposed to same-sex marriage but I would like to talk about a burger fell versus Hodges a 5-4 decision that was based largely on the Due Process Clause of the 14th amendment and in particular this notion of substantive due process and a fundamental right in substantive due process and could you sort of explain and contrast the view of the majority versus the view of the minority and what that might mean not what only men have been for that case but what it might mean for future cases sure the Due Process Clause of the 14th amendment is the relevant phrase here is pretty brief it says no one shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law 

[TEXT]
and that it's from that phrase that we get this doctor and that Ric is referring to called substantive due process the idea is that this this phrase this vague phrase contains within a protection for certain substantive rights so it is that portion of the Due Process Clause that the court has relied upon in finding a right to abortion for example so in locating rights within that phrase and the equal protection clause is also relevant here as well that no state shall deny to anyone any person equal protection of the laws the court that is a particularly controversial area that substantive due process area because it is an area in which the court that the in which the court says for itself what it thinks those rights are based on what it thinks contemporary values are at the time so Justice Scalia was now a fan of substantive due process because he felt like listen it says no one shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law that's a procedural guarantee about what happens to you before your property or your life is taken away for example that it doesn't contain a substantive guarantee saying that you know the state has to provide you certain guarantees or the state through legislation can't do certain things so on obergefell and this is the New York Times headline problem I think is that case got reported and as I heard my students even talk about it even in law school even after they'd become kind of acculturated to some of these things people were presenting it as a vote on the court for or against same-sex marriage but that's a that's not what the opinion was about what the opinion was about was who gets to decide whether we have same-sex marriage or not with the majority saying that it was a right guaranteed by the Constitution and so therefore states were not free and I mean that Odysseus tying himself to the mass sense that states weren't free to say that marriage had to be between a man and a woman and the dissenters weren't taking a view in fact Chief Justice Roberts dissent was very explicit about that he said you know those who want same-sex marriage you know you have every right to to lobby and state legislatures to make that happen but the dissents view was that it wasn't for the court to decide that the Constitution didn't speak to the question and so that it was a change that should occur through the legislative process and indeed many states were already moving in that direction and making legislative changes so I think obergefell and and what we're talking about for the future of the court it's really a who decides question people often ask and Rick and I talked about a little bit a little bit about this yesterday well in what cases might we expect to see this controversy of who decides when would it matter if if flurry Clinton wins one example would be that the court in a case when justice rehnquist was the chief decided that there was not a constitutional right to die and it reached that decision it was a substantive due process case interpreting this phrase no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law 

[TEXT]
but the methodology that the court adopted there said okay we will recognize that there is maybe some substantive component to that guarantee so we'll recognize something about substantive due process doctrine but we will only recognize a right as one that's protected by the Constitution by substantive due process I'm not talking about the First Amendment Fourth Amendment and all that I'm just talking about the abstract rights that the court has found in that substantive due process doctrine the court said we will only find such a right if there has been a long tradition in America see where the winds are blowing right now in society we will look at American history and American traditions and say yes this is a right for example early substance of due process cases dealt with the right of parents to educate their children that would be a right where the court could see you know that sort of firmly rooted history with the right to die the court said there has been no long-standing tradition in America of protecting a right to die and so we will not recognize that right I could imagine that case coming out differently and that precedent being overruled if Hillary Clinton is president because as we all know there's a big push now and I mean we see this and other countries we see it in Canada we see it in different European countries we've seen a big press for it in the United States a press for a right to die and I think that's going to be an issue when when legislative change is slow because people increasingly see the court as a political institution when they can't accomplish things in the legislature they try to litigate it and then declare a fast Rin through the court because I think it's faster to get it through the justices than to convince their citizens and citizens in the legislative process so that's an example where the methodology of who decides matter you know if we're going to have assisted suicide if we're gonna have right to die some states have already gone that route the question is is that something that people decide on a state-by-state basis or does the Supreme Court impose a national rule that tells some states you're not free to make it illegal to commit suicide that's really well put I can tell you in in our public policy class I tell you our students we're having this conversation right now and and the example you gave on right-to-die is a real-life one one of my own and I admit that a lot of people may disagree with this position but one of the reasons I personally get concerned about not tying substantive due process to history and tradition is that then policymaking to me can become very unfettered based on just whatever you happen to think for example in the future and this is more hypothetical but I could see it happening the case comes before the court in the future and it's a substantive due process case and what is you get five unelected lawyers who disagree with four unelected lawyers and it could be is there a fundamental right to health care is there a fundamental right to a living wage is there a fundamental right to housing 

[TEXT]
and in our class we talk about this these may all be terrific public policies and maybe Congress should pass a statute or maybe the president should go to Congress but the question that you raised earlier is a really big one and that it to me is that who sets policy for the country and does judicial and the effect of judicial philosophy on setting that policy so can you can you comment on how you see that may be impacting real-life cases beyond right-to-die yeah um I think let's see so sub I I think there are a number of areas I can just tick off a couple quickly in constitutional law where that who decides issue would be big and I actually think there's some in the statutory context that would matter a lot as well I think the death penalty is likely you know the court the court has had an uneasy relationship with the death penalty for a long time it came very close to holding the death penalty constitutional in the set in the late 70s early 80s and then as the court came back the states states that one of the death penalty really pushed back and then the court retreated I think there's a question of who decides there is that a state decision is that a constitutional decision I think right to die I think abortion I think people phrase the abortion question when they think about the Supreme Court as is Roe versus Wade gonna be overruled well versus way it actually isn't the law it was superseded by Casey versus Planned Parenthood but we've had you know 30 plus years of a court that did take you know on the whole a more conservative approach to the judicial role in Roe versus Wade Casey versus Pennsylvania left Roe largely intact reinstated a new test but still there I don't think that abortion or the right to abortion is would change some of the restrictions but I think some of the restrictions would change I think that's what we just saw last term in the case out of Texas states you know after the Kermit Gosnell affair and all of that states have imposed regulations on abortion clinics and I think the question is how much freedom the court is willing to let States have in regulating abortion I think the question of you know the court has held that in some circumstances states can render partial-birth abortion illegal very late term abortions I think that's the kind of thing that would change I don't think that the core case that grows core holding that you know women have a right to an abortion I don't think that would change but I think the question of whether people can get very late term abortions you know how many restrictions can be put on clinics I think that would change I think another area which people often overlook is statutory justice scalia cared a lot about statutory interpretation and this idea it's similar to his idea it was of a piece of his view of the Constitution which is that when Congress enacts a statute the words matter you interpret the words as they're written and if Congress made a mistake I mean I'm not talking about you know a scriveners error but if Congress didn't anticipate everything that would unfold you know if the circumstances change the judge doesn't have license to change the statute that is a who decides question that it falls back to Congress 

[TEXT]
I think a lot of the cases that we're going to see coming to the court now are involved statutory interpretation the court just took up that transgender bathroom case from North Carolina that's a statutory question that's a question involving the interpretation of title 9 which prohibits educational institutions that receive federal money which you know all almost all of them do from the Department of Education from discriminating on the basis of sex and the Department of Education and the Department of Justice you interpreted that phrase and telling North Carolina in that case that it had to permit physiological of someone who is physiologically a boy but identifying as a girl to use the girls bathroom that is a huge shift right and this is why it's made the news that would be a big shift and it's a shift from the prior interpretations of that statute which said separating locker rooms and showers and bathrooms on the basis of gender were okay that's a big shift and it's a who decides questions so that's pending on the court and and you know there are a lot of reasons why might one might say that's a public policy debate people will feel passionately on either side about whether physiological males who identify as female should be permitted in bathrooms especially with our young girls present and we've seen all these debates it's a coup decides question when title 9 was enacted it's pretty clear that no one including the Congress that enacted that statute would have dreamed of that result at that time maybe things have changed so that we should change title 9 maybe you know those arguing in favor of this kind of transgender bathroom access are right that's a policy debate to have but it does seem to strain the text of the statute to say that title nine demands it so is that the kind of thing that the court should interpret the statute to kind of update it to pick sides in this public policy debate or should we go to our Congress should we go to our legislators and say if this is the policy that we want to have now now we have new recognition of the rights of transgender people and we want to shift the policy is that kind of see change the sort of thing that should come legislatively or from the court and I think we're going to continue to see cases like that there's another case pending about doctors I don't know if you follow this Peter there's a lawsuit that's been filed because HHS relying on that same language in title 9 has now interpreted the Affordable Care Act to require doctors to provide transitional surgeries and not discriminate if doctors and hospitals including Catholic hospitals receive federal funds which they all do because of Medicaid so do we have some questions from the audience I was asked early can we just maybe read them or do you have some actually give the microphone to some people for some of the people sure sure I will we have some questions from the audience do you have a question Richard go ahead microphone we've talked about all these cases on the due process but there are other you know amendments that are you know that are you know you have the whole concept of starry decisis and out how do you view the court role in things like the First Amendment 

[TEXT]
case you have the you know the Citizens United which you know both sides are arguing right politically not legally and you know I guess it's a hell are case in DC about the guns so you have all these different amendments right which are far from the 14th but they they have settled reasonably settled law and we're we're how does that liberal conservative apply in those kind of cases which are relatively settled well citizens united in Heller are both fairly recent so I think the court started as Isis the court is always at pains to say that star decisis is a matter of policy not an extra Bowl command is the language that it uses so while the court star decisis is the principle that the court will generally not disturb the cases that it's already decided unless it has some good reason for doing so and I think that citizens united and Heller would both be vulnerable if if Hillary Clinton wins because they are cases which you know in which the dissenters in those cases who will still be on the court at those cases are revisited felt passionately that the court got it wrong and that is one of the factors that the court considers and whether to abandon a prior case the reality is that Heller because Heller protected the right to have handgun in the home but it didn't say that there couldn't be other restrictions on guns and the court has been giving a lot of leeway to restricting guns I don't actually know if there would be as much interest in getting rid of Heller in particular because most gun restrictions are still standing but Citizens United I thought would be a pretty easy target professor raised a really interesting question on this statutory construction issue I think many people including myself tend to think so much about the Constitution itself that is there a liberal or conservative approach to statutory construction and one good case I think to maybe touch on briefly would be King versus Burwell a good example that is not a death penalty or social issue case but healthcare you remember there were two big challenges to the Affordable Care Act the first one in National Federation and the second one on statutory construction and clearly wasn't there a liberal and conservative divide and how to determine whether or not there is a federal or state exchange can we come in on that but also in the sense of what this might mean how a how a court of one persuasion of the other can have such a profound public policy effect sure so King versus Burwell was the second challenge to the affordable care act and it was a statutory challenge not a constitutional challenge basically the statute the affordable care act provided sir subsidies that the tax subsidies the language of the statute said that you got them when you purchase your insurance on an exchange established by the state and state was defined in the statute to include the 50 states in the District of Columbia it distinguished even between states and territories Congress when it enacted the statute anticipated because of the Medicaid pressure the Medicaid deal in the statute 

[TEXT]
that all stat all states would adopt exchanges but then as we know the end of that story many states resisted adopting exchanges so the government the federal government had to set up some exchanges and then the question was well gosh the people who have purchased their health insurance from the federal exchanges federal exchange wouldn't qualify for the tax subsidy and that could have a disastrous effect on the statute Justice Scalia like the text of the text list approach was okay well maybe Congress didn't accurately foresee what was going to happen Congress doesn't have perfect foresight or maybe Congress wanted this to be part of the pressure Congress didn't really want a federal exchange because it looked too much like a single-payer system so maybe this was an unseen bargain maybe what they wanted to do is pressure states to take the exchange that the fact that their citizens wouldn't get the subsidy if they had to go to a federal exchange would have been some pressure creating and putting pressure on the states to actually set these exchanges so Justice Scalia basically said well this is what the statute says and now that events have unfolded so that it seems like this isn't this is going to have some bad effects for the Affordable Care Act we can't go back and change what the statute says but the other justices disagree kind of a pretty good example of the difference in construction between the two did you have a question in the in the first affordable care act case yes the this yeah National Federation of Independent businesses there was a heavy statutory construction and component to that case to because this is not a tax right the individual mandate but the court in an effort and the court and a good way tries to avoid constitutional questions but the the controversy in that particular case was that to avoid the Constitution they very creatively interpreted the statute to be a tax question from Eric Smith Amy we have a question in the back from mr. Smith thank you how awesome it is to have a professor here from Notre Dame that worked with the Great Justice Scalia and thank you Rick and the Public Policy Institute for having her here and making this possible I was an elected official here for 25 years and arguably the poster child for term limits but I want to ask this question I and that's a wonderful law students when I was a professor and and we got the impression and working working with the cases from Justice Scalia that he held people like me legislators Congress congressman in in low esteem could you just disprove that and it's it's okay if you don't but he didn't seem to have whole congressmen and legislators in the highest esteem that's my question thank you so much Wow um let's see he was not a fan of legislative history to be sure so he often took aim at legislative history I never heard him disparage legislators at all I mean I think that he did sometimes question a number of the courts doctrines call for giving deference to the constitutional judgments made by legislatures and I do know that towards the end of the lot towards the end of his life he had expressed scepticism that many members of Congress spent much time contemplating the Constitution and whether statute was constitutional before they enacted it 

[TEXT]
I don't know that he had I mean he had great respect for the democratic process so I think the the logical conclusion of that to me would be that he also had great respect for those who represented us in the democratic process press appear to have one last question and I'm gonna ask you for some closing comments if you would here's the last question actually is it asked you to look a little bit into your crystal ball in one of the presidential debates the two candidates were asked about appointment of justices and what their concerns were for the future what their priorities were Hillary Clinton talked about abortion and citizens united Donald Trump talked about gun rights and Heller and there's a tendency of course to look at those social issues in particular with a lot of emotion but beyond those cases looking to 217 and beyond what are some of the significant matters that you think will come before the court and where the composition of the court could matter to the outcome sure um I think right to die I said we've touched on some of them already I think the statutory cases will be big I think these title 9 interpretation cases I think religious exemptions are gonna be really big I think you know that was the Hobby Lobby case that Notre Dame was and the Little Sisters of the Poor were among the religious institutions challenging the application of the contraceptive mandate California as a state has mandated that all ensured all employers and insurers provide coverage for elective abortions and they can do that as a state because the the only thing that the only basis for that challenge at the federal level was the Religious Freedom Restoration Act we're going to continue to see those challenges there's been a conscience exemption to doctors for performing procedures abortions or some of these you know transitional changes performing mastectomy x' on women who wanted to transition to men there's been a conscience for doctors to this point this lawsuit I was mentioning challenges that that's that's being kind of dialed back so I think on all of these things these are kind of hot and heavy matters of public debate that we disagree about you know that citizens are trying to persuade each other one way and another and I think the question of who decides those questions whether they're left to the electorate or whether the court and administrators decide them is big those are some great comments you've kind of you've kind of gone to my last which is we're out of time for tonight but I wanted to ask if you had any given this historic point that we're at I think the people this room would all agree this is a unique and historic time that the election on Tuesday will be very consequential 

[TEXT]
people are talking about a lot of areas but particularly for the people in this room in terms of the court and the direction of the court and issues will be decided you have any comments as a constitutional law scholar and professor and maybe clerked for Justice Scalia's to your thoughts about the future of the court and where we're heading gosh it is a consequential moment and the who decides question just as a personal matter is really important to me and so I guess I I worry a lot you know about the who decides question about our decisions you know and my voice is kind of getting taken away depending on on what happens and and and that could be true you know and either candidates selection of nominees but that I think is the question for me well I on behalf of the Public Policy Institute I have a little special presentiment I hope all of you will agree with me that this has been a terrific evening with Professor bhaer would you all agree and we have two gifts for you it's so nice not to be in government anymore where I can do this this is one that will remind you of our Public Policy Institute and this is something that we hope you just find this nice but I will say I hope all of you had agreed that this forced Hesburgh lecture was a very good one I hope you've enjoyed the last hour don't forget to vote thank you all very very much.

[SUMM]
A little bit about Justice Scalia and what his absence from the court will mean and then shift and talk in a broader brush about what's coming for the court and what the election will mean for the court. Lots of press on the issue of the replacement of Justice Scalia. A discussion about Hillary and her policies towards guns. When choosing policies, do we go to legislators, or do we go based on what the larger group of people want. The direct representation is lacking.      There is more text here

Good morning everybody. So most of you know that Christina Seyfried is the head teaching fellow in the course. But what you don't know about her is that she's writing a dissertation, she's an advanced graduate student in political science writing a dissertation about China in Africa. And has spent much of the last two years in Nigeria, Ethiopia, South Africa and elsewhere studying just what the Chinese are doing there. She is also the brains and energy behind Yale's China-Africa initiative that has been going on for the last several years. So it seemed absurd for me to be giving this lecture when there's somebody who knows in such more intricate detail about what's going on then Christina so, Christina, welcome. The floor is yours. (audience clapping) - Great, thank you so much, professor. Welcome, everyone. I just wanna say I feel extremely honored to be giving this lecture today on China in Africa, especially because my journey really with this topic started three years ago. In my first semester here at Yale when I took a class with Professor Shapiro at the business school, and one of the lectures was on China in Africa. And I found the topic extremely interesting. And I started to read more about it. But I was a little bit not completely satisfied with the rather China centric angle that literature was taking on the topic. So I decided to write my dissertation on how African governments strategize around Chinese investments in their countries. And I spent 10 months of doing field research now in the African region. And as I said, I feel extremely honored now to be back and to be standing on the other side now of the classroom, and to teach a lecture on China-Africa myself and to share some of the lessons from my research with you today. So to start us off, I brought you a video from the forum on China-Africa cooperation, that just happened in September of last year. And China started these forums in 2000. And they have been happening every three years. And China uses them as a platform in order to announce a strategy for Africa. So in terms of loans, trade and investment for the next three year period. - [Woman] Building a community with a shared future and seeking inclusive growth, the opening ceremony of this year's summit for the forum on China-Africa cooperation, saw President Xi Jinping outline his vision for China's ties with the African continent in the new era. (speaking foreign language) - [Translator] China is the largest developing country in the world, and Africa is home to the largest number of developing countries. China and Africa have already formed a community with a shared future. We stand united with Africa's people thinking with one mind and working with one heart. - [Woman] President Xi Jinping has announced eight major initiatives in the coming three years. (speaking foreign language) - [Translator] The framework of the 10 major cooperation plans, China will work closely with African countries and implement eight major initiatives in the next three years and beyond. It feels like industrial acceleration, infrastructure connectivity, trade facilitation, green development, capacity building, healthcare, people to people exchanges, and peace and security. (speaking foreign language) In order to promote the successful implementation of the eight major initiatives, China will provide $60 billion in support for Africa. 

[TEXT]
For government assistance, financial institutions, and financing from Chinese enterprises. It will include $15 billion in free aid, interest free loans, and concessional loans. $20 billion in credit funds, $10 billion in China-Africa developmental financing, $5 billion in special funds for import trade from Africa, no less than $10 billion in investment from Chinese companies over the next three years. - [Woman] Already the summit has passed two outcome documents, including the Beijing declaration and the FOCAC action plan 2019 to 2021. Participants say that in a current era of globalization, all nations have a common destiny. And to put it in the words of President Xi, everyone has in himself, a little bit of others. - So as you can see, a lot of big announcements were made at this forum. And this last image here has actually become very famous because for the first time in the history of these forums, 53 out of 54 African countries were represented. And I remember an African newspaper called Africa News wrote at the time that this was the week where the African continent was bereft of its leaders because everyone was hanging out in Beijing. So this is just really the most recent peak of China-Africa relations that have gained more and more international attention from practitioners and academics over really the past 10 years or so. But why is it that this has become such a hot topic from a developmental point of view I mean? And in order to answer this question, I would like us to take a step back and think about what are the African regions persistent growth obstacles? And I brought you a comparison here from 1982 to 2016. And you see in the 1980s, China really was poor agricultural, and had just emerged out of a series of intense conflict, namely the Cultural Revolution. And you see that China was in fact poorer than most African countries, except for Guinea Bissau and Uganda. But fast forward to 2016, China is now richer than most African countries except for Equatorial Guinea and the Seychelles. And I know in lecture four we studied very much in detail China's growth miracle. But what was meanwhile happening in the African region. So after decolonization, several African leaders starting in Nigeria, Zambia and Tanzania, tried to import substitution industrialization. And that means you basically keep your economy closed to international trade and you try to grow and develop local industries first that compete within the domestic market. But that is an economic growth recipe really failed. So after several debts and oil crisis, the IMF and the World Bank stepped into Africa and implemented so called structural adjustment programs. 

[TEXT]
And the idea was that everything needed to solve Africa's poverty was real neoliberalism through the Washington Consensus. So deregulation, privatization, and liberalization. And after that, everything would fall into place. But that logic was flawed. And even after these countries went through structural adjustment programs, foreign investors weren't really willing to come to Africa still. So at the turn of the millennial, Jeffrey Sachs who was a very famous economist at Columbia. He also worked on the Millennium Development Goals with the UN. He wrote this famous piece on Africa being caught in a poverty trap. And what he's saying is that because of diseases, low stocks of human capital, technology, high transportation costs and an adverse geopolitical location, Africa is really stuck with both weak growth and weak institutions. And we have studied the modernization theory that says that growth supposedly leads to strong institutions. But the question here is what leads to growth in the first place. And he's saying that foreign investors don't want to come to the African region, because they aren't strong institutions that could enforce property rights, the rule of law, et cetera. And he's really advocating for aid as the solution to Africa. And there are economists such as William Easterly or Dambisa Moyo who highly criticize this call for aid as a solution for poverty. But it remained the fact that the African region wasn't able to attract much investment. And then, with the wake of the financial crisis in 2008, it looked even more dire because you have the collapse of the Washington Consensus. And if this hit to this overconfidence and neoliberalism as a concept and then the solution to end poverty, and you really see a retraction of Western investment in Africa, also because the West is running capital shortages, as they have to bail out banks at home. So now the question is, where can Africa attract investment from now? But as Deborah Brautigam in her book that you were also supposed to read for this lecture today, predicted, China meanwhile is rising and is running huge capital surpluses. So where others are exiting as the path of least resistance going back to Hirschman, who we have studied as well. China now fills the void that the West is leaving and increases its presence in Africa. Hence we know that China has lifted millions of people out of poverty. And I would really recommend this book by Ang "How China Escaped the Poverty Trap". So now the question is, is China just a new colonialist? Or is its presence going to add something beneficial to the African continent? And as I walk you through the slides, I would like you to think about this question, whether it is even the right question to ask and I'll also offer you my opinion, as we move along. So for today's agenda, I will provide you with a quick historic overview on China-Africa relations, then I'll give you a big picture of what China is doing in Africa today. And then we'll dive into some key questions that I think are important to ask about this relationship. And I will use two case studies, Nigeria and Ethiopia, which are among the top receivers of Chinese assistance in Africa. 

[TEXT]
And then I'll talk about some lessons and I wanna bring up this idea of African bargaining power here and how much African agency matters in this relationship. And then finally I'll give you my two cents on where I think this relationship with China is going in the future. So a lot of people think that China really started to become present in Africa in the early 2000s. When in fact, we have to go back to the end of World War II. And African countries are slowly becoming independent, while China is meanwhile fighting its own domestic conflict, where the communists had just driven out the nationalists to Taiwan. And Beijing, China is now looking for allies in this Beijing-Taiwan conflict. And after independence, 14 African countries actually decided to side with Beijing here. And we have very skillful leaders like Sekou Toure in Guinea who played the United States and the Soviet Union against each other in their aid offers. And then he secretly accepted $25 million from China on the backside. China at that time is also rewarding socialists and communist movements as in Guinea but also in Ghana and Mali but after the Sino-Soviet split, which was basically about personal differences between Mao Zedong and Nikita Khrushchev, but also different ideological interpretation of Marx Leninism. Sorry, Marxism-Leninism. China has an interest in keeping up this non aligned world that neither sides with the US or the Soviet Union here. And what's really interesting is that in 1971, Beijing, China is actually able to gain back a seat at the UN that had been previously occupied by Taiwan. And Tanzania was very, very vocal here in these negotiations. So we studied how in 1978, China opened up its borders to the world. And it officially starts its bringing in period where it is trying to attract as much foreign capital as possible. And what's really striking here is that China is the only developing country in the world that is also offering aid to other developing countries. And the strategy here is very much based on its own experience as an aid recipient for example from Japan. That during that time knocked on China stores and said, we'll offer you low interest, low interest loans for technology and material and in exchange for crude oil. And we see very similar deals still being made today between China and Africa. And we studied how China was able to rise very fast. So starting in the early 1990s, China's running huge capital surpluses and is officially entering this going out period, that we're still in today. And China is trying to put its capital abroad, to invest it abroad, and it really uses its aid as a strategic tool to promote Chinese exports, and to help Chinese infant companies really grow and learn in other countries. And it also positions itself sort of as an alternative to Western aid. So in 2005 in Tanzania President Mkapa, he really when he stepped down, wanted to give his population kind of as a departure gift, a football stadium. But the problem was that Tanzania was on the list of highly indebted poor nations. 

[TEXT]
And they were supposed to actually run austerity measures, and couldn't spend all that money. But then he went to China and China said, okay, we're willing to build you that football stadium. It's gonna be smaller, but we're still gonna build you one. So he was happy. But what's very interesting is that in the early 2000s, China seems to have accepted the rules of neoliberalism. And the US is an economic headroom at that time, because it joins the WTO at a lot of pressure from the US and it seems like it wants to play by the capitalist international rules that were set up by the US. But then as we studied the financial crisis hits in 2008, and this is also a hit to this overconfidence that neoliberalism is sort of the way to go. And it gets a lot of affirmation to the Beijing, China model which is the state capitalism and that it sometimes it's better if the government owns companies in a certain sector that is deemed strategic. And if you have large infrastructure investments and that sort of an interventionist approach by the government is more effective than leaving everything to the private market. And an embodiment of this new confidence that China has found is the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the Belt and Road Initiative that I'll talk about in a little bit. But I would really recommend this book by Kurlantzick here, where he also talks about the effect of state capitalism and the spread of it in today's world on democracy if you're interested. And as I said, the most recent peak of China-Africa relations has really been this FOCAC meeting of 2018 where you saw the clip, where really China is trying to rebrand this relationship with Africa and it has signal that it's been listening to the concerns about debt traps, et cetera. So it seems like the relationship has matured or that's at least the narrative about it. So what is China doing an Africa today and I'll briefly walk you through loans and trade, which are oftentimes in the news. But then I also wanna talk about investments, which is what I'm focusing on and it's a smaller sector of Chinese involvement, but growing. And then I'll also talk very briefly about China's military presence in Africa. So China's loan strategy in Africa is very much based on this idea of state capitalism, that you need to take a lot of money into your hands first, and invest in infrastructure and sort of get in the early stages of development, kind of the state to make growth happen. And as we know, African countries sometimes have shortages of money. So these loans serve that they lend to these countries now so that they can build infrastructure which is pre-stage of industrialization, in order to make growth and development happen. And just to give you an idea of how big these loans are today, we see that really, the loans from the China Exim Bank are already competing with World Bank loans. So the same magnitude that we're talking about today. 

[TEXT]
But there's a big difference between World Bank and Chinese loans, namely that World Bank loans come with strings attached. So this is based on the structural adjustment programs today so we have austerity measures, and if you're expected to have fiscal prudence, where Chinese loans really have no strings attached. And a lot of people are concerned about this because if this money gets into the hands of politicians, they could misuse this, could also be a way of China sort of making African countries more dependent on itself. Or it could also be kind of China thinking long term, it gives loans to countries that can't pay back these loans. And then it can take over, let's say ports as it happened in Sri Lanka in 2017. And we'll talk about this a little bit later whether these concerns are justified. So China also gives us these loans as part of the Belt and Road initiative. And this initiative as I said, was launched in 2013. And it is part of China's going out and going global strategy. And China right now is building trade infrastructure in Eurasia. And it's really meant to build trade routes in Eurasia, that is going to compete with the Transatlantic trade route that is currently being dominated by the United States. So here you again see this confidence that China has in its own development approach. And what's interesting, China's already Africa's most important trading partner. And you can look at these graphs, I'm gonna post them up. But really, the essence of this is that China is exporting more to Africa than Africa is exporting to China. And that was also one of the big topics that the FOCAC of 2018 that China was asked by African countries to also import more from Africa. So as I said, loans and trade kind of dominating the headlines, but Chinese investments in Africa, also a growing sector. So you see that the United States and the former colonial powers is still really leading here. But if you look at a change of five years, they're pretty stable. But when you look at China, this is really rapidly increasing. And I really like this graph here, which is the comparison between US and Chinese investment flows to Africa. And when you look at the blue line here, I think it shows very nicely that you have an upward sloping trend line until the financial crisis and then under the Obama area, those flows really drop. And now if we could extend this to the Trump area, Trump he focuses more, he has more military concerns than kind of foreign direct investment priorities. But when we look at China here, you see an upward sloping trend line and there's one outlier. That's when China bought 20% of the shares of the Standard Bank in South Africa. But I think the essence of this graph is really external shocks really don't matter as much to investment flows of China, and also changes in political leadership, et cetera. So I think this shows that China intends to be in Africa for a longer, longer future. 

[TEXT]
And we can't say really the same about the US, we don't know what's gonna happen. And here just to give you an idea, investments, Chinese investments in Africa, very diverse, and the biggest sectors are construction, transportation, manufacturing. And I think this really nicely fits into Sun's story of the Flying Geese Theory and the geese flying to Africa now. Where we have talked about the Flying Geese Theory a little bit when we talked about China. Capital basically moves to wherever labor is the cheapest, and we saw Japan industrialize in the '50s. And as labor prices increase there they moved to other areas in East Asia. And now because labor is increasing, labor prices are increasing so much in China. We see a lot of Chinese manufacturers moving to Africa and actually, I conducted a lot of interviews with Chinese manufacturers in Africa, in Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya, other places that are really said, I'm here because this looks like China in the '70s. And it's really amazing labor is so cheap, land is so cheap. So officially, China's saying that it is interested in an economic and sort of cultural exchange with Africa. But people are getting more and more concerned also about China's military presence, because right now China is already the Security Council member that deploys the largest amount of troops under UN command in Africa. And what you need to know here is that African countries don't really like if soldiers from neighboring countries are deployed inside their countries because ethnically which is oftentimes cross national borders. So now the AU, the African Union and the UN might like to employ and have Chinese military stationed in these countries to avoid this problem. And then China also set up its first military base in Djibouti that also raised a lot of concerns and I have a little clip. - [Woman] A fleet of Chinese ships en route to the Horn of Africa on a mission to set up China's first overseas military base in Djibouti. China's is the base will be used to support peacekeeping and relief missions. (speaking foreign language) - [Translator] The establishment of the base will help Chinese vessels escort missions in the Gulf of Eden and Somalia and international obligations such as humanitarian rescue missions. It helps China to continue to make even greater contributions to the peace and stability of Africa and the rest of the world. - [Woman] Construction began on the base last year. Although small, Djibouti is strategically placed, sitting on a busy shipping route and a stable country in an otherwise volatile region. China now joins the ranks of several other nations with military bases in Djibouti, including the US, France and Japan. But China's new base and rapid modernization of its military is raising alarm bells for neighboring countries, particularly India. With concern this base could become another one of China's so called string of pearls, building up strategic military alliances and sea lanes in the region. - So I think we can all agree that whatever China's doing in Africa, it's a very wholistic strategy. And China has really increased its presence in Africa in the early 2000s. 

[TEXT]
And it seems like it wants to stay for a near and medium future. So I think there are a couple of key questions that we should be asking on this relationship that really try to get at what are China's intentions but also what is in it for the African side. So first of all, going back to our central question from the beginning, is China a new colonialist? Or is this presence adding to local development on the ground in Africa? And are the final colonialists here by a foreign power that tries to take partial or complete political control over another nation, as well as engages in economic exploitation? Then the second central question is how does China's presence add to institutional development? So sort of more on the political side. Does it have good or bad governance? Thirdly, are debt trap claims justified? And these are all questions that really media and scholarship has been trying to analyze and answer. And I would like to throw in a fourth question, which is how much bargaining power do African governments have in their relationship with China? And how do they use it? Is there leverage on the African side to influence what this China-Africa story might look like? And so on this key question of China, is China new colonialist, China's officially running a five nos policy in Africa. So it's this five nos policy is very much based on its general policy of non intervention. So that's also why China is not supporting the responsibility to protect or to keep because it's basically saying every nation is responsible for its own population. And we're not going to intervene with anyone else's affairs, as we also don't want anyone to step into our domestic politics. That's also why China oftentimes vetoes sort of intervention. So resolutions at the UN, also with Syria for example. So here you see Xi Jinping talk about his five nos policy in Africa. (speaks foreign language) - [Translator] China values sincerity, friendship and equality in pursuing cooperation. The over 1.3 billion times people have been with the over 1.2 billion African people in pursuing a shared future. We respect Africa, we love Africa and support Africa. We follow a five no approach in our relations with Africa. No interference in African countries pursuit of development path fitting their national conditions. No interference in African countries internal affairs. No imposition of our will on African countries. No attachment of political strings to systems to Africa. And not seeking of selfish political gains in investment and financing cooperation with Africa. - So you see here China's official stance on this is, of course, we're not a new colonialist. We're not interested in kind of political control. We're just really as I said before, interested in economic and cultural exchange. But of course they're also more critical voices on this China-Africa relationship. And I brought you here a comic by a famous South African artist. And you see basically China coming in with those big machines, and it says China's industrial colonialism. And these machines are going against the local population. And here you also see, Africa's environment is also suffering from so the expansionary vision of China and Africa. 

[TEXT]
And when you look at Western newspaper reports, there are also a lot of articles like on Chinese debt trap diplomacy again with those loans, economical cold war. Is it a new colonialism? Chinese investments bring racism and discrimination. And I also talked to locals that have told me that the Chinese they just take all the jobs. So it really, everyone is split about this topic. So I would like to have a poll now on sort of from your background knowledge on China and Africa, what do you have heard from the news, et cetera, who thinks that China is a new colonialist in Africa? Okay, that's a lot of people. I didn't expect that. So who thinks China's influence in Africa is really kind of they're actually better than what the former colonialists have done? Okay, yeah. And who was split on this topic? Yeah. So I think the vast majority thinks that China is the new colonialists. So I'll just give you my opinion on this issue. So I think if China is a new colonialist, which I actually doubt is, first of all, it is a very different kind of colonialism. Because as you've seen in that famous image, 53 out of 54 African countries actually deliberately selected into it. So it wasn't like China, just coming to Africa and kind of taking over political control. but it is they are offering deals and the Chinese side is can either accept them or not. And there are a lot of speeches from African leaders from this forum that talk very favorably about China and how their relationship is different with China than with the West because of this non intervention. We also talked about how altropy is is sort of Europe centric. And it could also lend itself to again, like colonialist aspirations, et cetera. So this is sort of an agreement here. But I think obviously, the Chinese government, the West and African leaders, they're self interested actors, and they're very irrational in sort of what narrative they put out there. So I think instead of listening to what different leaders are saying here, we should focus more on impact and the variables that we can actually measure of what China is doing in Africa. And I think there are three questions that are probably the most productive to focus on if we want to have a real assessment here of whether China is a new colonialist. The first one is, is China helping to grow and diversify African economies? And this one is really important from both an economic development perspective but also from an institutional one and also in terms of democratic one. First of all, economic one because we want to see with China's presence in Africa, are African countries that are mostly agricultural now, are they moving more towards industry? And from an institutional perspective, I know we started to risk it all in detail where they're all saying we can't really predict when a democracy, like when the transformation to a democracy becomes more likely. 

[TEXT]
But what can we say about its survival? So we know that democracies are more likely to survive if they have a higher per capita income than $14,000 as well as they have a diversified economy. And then I want to ask two more questions, which are is China adding local human capital and technology? And how does the competition with local businesses look like? And these two questions are really inspired by China's own growth miracle, because when China opened up in 1978, it invited a lot of foreign investors and provided incentives, all of that, to come into specific industries. But what's very interesting about China is that it actually kept a pretty strict foreign investment catalog, where it laid out certain sectors that were completely restricted to foreign investment and others where foreign investment was allowed and encouraged but had caps on foreign equity that was allowed for a joint venture requirements and also requirements and how many foreigners were allowed on the boards of companies. So they're much I summarize, this is local participation requirements. And China was using them really as a magnifier effect because China was able to import the technology from abroad and get the money from abroad, but it built a second of local managers that could then run the show. And this is also one of the explanations as to why China was able to grow and develop so fast, because locals learned very much and very fast from foreigners in their countries. And before I dive into my case studies, Nigeria and Ethiopia, I just wanna point out that, this idea that there's One China Inc. Africa is also flawed. So I know we talk about China and Africa, now also use the term just for simplicity reasons. But through my research, I found that there actually at least three different types of Chinese companies in Africa that have very different incentives that are worth studying. So first of all, you have state owned enterprises, and they're very much linked to China's sort of state capitalism model. They are very dependent on the Chinese government's control. And oftentimes, they're both driven by an economic incentive as well as sort of a different diplomatic kind of relationship, let's say between China and Nigeria where these companies are allowed to operate at razor thin profit margins. If this is important enough for the strategic relationship between an African country and China. Then you also have big private firms like Huawei who come to Africa to really they're very profit driven. I've talked to CEOs from Huawei who really want to compete with Western companies in Africa. But they have such a high profile that they can't really hide from the Chinese government. And so they're still dependent sort of, on China's, the Chinese government's strategy in Africa, and they can just do everything they want, because China's actually very concerned about its image in Africa. So they have still have to obey by certain rules. 

[TEXT]
And then there's a third category which I particularly find very interesting to study which is small, private firms. So how they come to Africa is in two ways. So sometimes you have Chinese state owned enterprises being sent to Africa. And then employees in the state owned enterprises are realizing, okay, we're not really making any money. So individual entrepreneurs, they venture off and they open a small company in Africa to really make more money than that sit on the enterprise. Or we have some small Chinese private companies already in Africa that do have friends back home in China. And they will tell them all like land here is really great. Like here, the taxes really low, et cetera. So you should come from China to here. And they keep a very low profile, and they hide a lot from the Chinese government as well. But what I would also like to add is the Chinese government doesn't really care if they hide or not as long as you're not big enough to really matter. And if you make an impression, if like your company screws up and it's gonna be in the news and stuff that could be could influence this image that China has in Africa. So I also talked a lot of two or three types. And as I said, they all have very different incentives. And that matters for the stories that I'm going to tell you now. So let's first focus on Nigeria. So Nigeria as a country in West Africa. And just to give you a little bit of background on Nigeria, it has the largest population in Africa, and also one of the largest youth populations in the world behind China and India. And it's a former British colony, and it went through a military period, military regime period. And it's been formally democratic since 2015, when Jonathan Goodluck deliberately stepped down to Muhammadu Buhari and democratic elections. And Muhammadu Buhari he just ran for a second term in February and I was actually in the country during that time. So it was very interesting to observe. So what's really interesting about Nigeria is that in the '70s and early '80s, it actually had the largest textile industry in Africa. So we had some diversification of the economy happening. But when we fast forward to today, 80% of all finished consumer goods are imported. And really, the economy is not diversified at all. So what happened there? So in 1958, Nigeria discovered oil, and by the 70s, this was really the largest sector of the economy. And I think that led to really three outcomes. So first of all, as we talked with the Soviet Union, if there's one dominant sector in a country, the political elites really have an interest in keeping that one sector dominant because they can grant access to the sector and they can make a lot of money versus if you try to diversify the economy and try to provide alternatives to the population, they would not pay you anymore to get access to the sector. 

[TEXT]
Secondly, there's also the Dutch disease and basically as your revenues increase in one particular sector, your currency appreciates and that makes exports from any other sector really expensive. So Norway is also an oil rich country, has tried to circumvent this issue by when it gets the revenues for its oil, it doesn't even convert them into its own currency but puts them into funds again abroad. So because Nigeria has all this oil, its GDP per capita is pretty high, but we have very high inequality. And it is one of the top receivers of Chinese investments. And those are not just investments in natural resources. But I also talked to a lot of manufacturers there, people in the service sector so it's a very attractive market because you have a huge population, very cheap land and very cheap labor. And what's important to note about Nigeria as well finally is that it really adapted the structural adjustment programs and went with it. So in 1995 it allowed 100% foreign ownership in all sectors. And really, if you're a foreign investor in Nigeria, you can basically do whatever you want. So you can compete with locals, you can make money there and you can export it abroad. So you can really have a lot of leeway there. So let's look at growth and diversification, as I said like that is one of our key questions, is China's presence adding to growth and diversification? And here you see that Nigeria actually just emerged out of a recession. And that was because of a drop in global oil prices and output chalking, Nigerian and advocate policy to really respond to this. And here you see how much Nigeria is, is really dependent on the oil industry, because over the past 20 years, the value added from industry actually declines so we don't see any diversification happening over the past 20 years unfortunately. So let's hone in a little bit on how China's presence is really adding maybe something to diversification and local participation in Nigeria. And what's interesting to note here is that in 2006, at another form of China-Africa cooperation, China announced that it wants to build eight special economic zones in Africa. And that was really based on this idea that China used special economic zones in the beginning of its opening up to really experiment with capitalism. And so they suggested kind of as a policy strategy, you should also build these zones and have tax incentives, tax holidays, and let's see what happens but the difference is that these zones are much smaller than the ones in China. So that's why they might not be working effectively. But Nigeria got two zones during this bidding process, the Lekki Free Trade Zone and the Ogun Guangdong Zone, and both are very much top down joint venture, joint venture project between state governments in Nigeria, as well as Chinese state owned enterprises. And I will show you a video now from the Lekki Free Trade Zone. - For many African countries, attracting foreign investments has always been a challenge. 

[TEXT]
And now it's become even more difficult with an economic downturn in Europe and the United States. So here's how some African countries have responded. They set up what are known as free trade zones. These are places where multinationals can come in, set up shop and in some cases, a little or sometimes no tax at all. It really does beg the question, what's in it for the ordinary African. Mark Edwards been checking up on that in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation. - [Mark] In Lagos they hope this will be the road to economic success. The Lekki Free Trade Zone is being carved out of thousands of hectares of untamed land near the coast of Nigeria's commercial capital. - The first part is 3,000 hectares. - [Mark] They call Sola Oworu the Empress of the zone. This former city banker is in charge of creating what she believes will become the Dubai of West Africa. - The idea is actually to create a new model city, not just industrial, also a residential, commercial area, so that you have a self sustaining city. - [Mark] While Lagos State providing the land, a Chinese consortium is responsible for the actual construction. There's a lot to build. The zone will have its own international airport, deep sea port, and its own water, power and sewage systems. - The idea is to have the zone as a catalyst for economic development in Lagos State, diversify the economy, we would want to attract foreign direct investments into Lagos State. - There are 23 other Free Trade Zones in Nigeria, all vying for the attentions of international investors. But the Lekki Free Trade Zone here in Lagos has one big advantage, size. At 16,500 hectares it could become the biggest in Africa, four times the size of Manhattan in New York. - So this is a video from 2013. And what's striking here is that you can't really see the zone itself, right? So I tried to find videos where you have some video footage, what it actually looks like, but I couldn't so I would have liked to show you. So I was wondering about that myself. So I went to the zone and I drove there and when you arrive there's a really nice building in front with the administration and like they welcomed me and I could talk to the MD, the managing director on the Nigerian side as well as on the Chinese side and everyone said, yeah, the zone is gonna be amazing and like all of that potential and it really is going super well. And then a team of engineers took me around the zone. So we came behind the administration building, and what you could really see was not that much, because there wasn't. So there was some basic infrastructure built. But I was driven around and I talked to a few companies that were really only 14 fully operating Chinese companies in the zone. 

[TEXT]
And that was after 13 years of being built, right? So I think it lags a little bit behind expectations. And one of the reasons I see is really, because it's more of a top down joint venture between two governments. So as I said before, you have Chinese state owned enterprise involved. And it is kind of bound to this diplomatic relationship between Nigeria and China and it is a prestige project. So that's why they build a lot of infrastructure there. But how to make the zone actually work is a different story. It is a very profit driven story. And when I saw kind of the management building and then like the office is there, they're very comfortable in that position, I don't really see that big of an incentive to go out of your way to really attract all of these companies. So while there's tax holidays, so no taxes inside the zone, there's a very high management fee actually. And I talked to companies that had considered moving into Lekki Free Trade Zone, but they didn't find it profitable because they were too small for the management fee to make sense. And finally, they were also locals that have been protesting because of resettlements. 'Cause that used to be their land who have been protesting a lot. And in 2012 actually, one of the managers of the zone got killed. So they'll have problems to make the zone really, really work and profitable. And we have a similar story for Ogun Guangdong. So now though I would say it is performing slightly better. So it was started with a Chinese state owned enterprise. And then they were caught up in some smuggling problems. And then a Chinese company actually took over the zone, the management of the zones. And they were more interested in kind of making the zone work because they were more profit driven. But then the Chinese government kicked them out, I believe two years ago and put in again, a Chinese Special Economic, SOE, State Owned Enterprise, because they felt like they had more control over what that company could be doing with this prestige project, which meant a lot for the diplomatic relationship between Nigeria and China. And there's a very interesting story that I would like to share with you. Professor Shapiro and I, we both separately, interviewed the private management at that time of the zone. And they told us they had one big problem, which was someone was blowing up the gas pipelines that were coming to the zone. So who do you think was blowing up these pipelines? Yes. No, it was not terrorists. Yeah. So what's really interesting is that you actually had locals blowing up these gas pipelines because they started sort of as a local competition, or like as a foreign project that they weren't really being able to have any advantage of. So again, have locals seeing the zone and like seeing the infrastructure, but not really being able to participate. 

[TEXT]
And as I said like in Nigeria, you can kind of just come in as a foreign company and you don't have to employ locals or train locals or have them on or kind of give them ownership. So I've heard a lot of stories of competition between Chinese companies and Nigerian ones. And obviously competition is good for kind of growth. But there's also the flip side of local inclusion. So I guess that is the trade off here. And I know these stories are just anecdotal. So I have like, for example, in the bike ride hailing services, and there's a really aggressive Chinese company right now or in the FinTech industry, whether a lot of Chinese companies Offering loans to locals, just competing on price alone. And I'm going to conduct a survey experiment with Chinese companies next semester in Nigeria to kind of get more at the trend here. So I don't only wanna talk about negative things about Nigeria, so they also some positive developments here. So for example, Aliko Dangote, he's the richest African right now. And what you need to know about Nigeria is that it exports all of its crude oil and imports the refined oil, because it's not doing the refining itself domestically. So Aliko Dangote is now currently building an oil gas refinery, in Lekki Free Trade Zone to solve this problem. And I talked to locals and they generally actually feel positive about it because they're excited that this is now finally that there's some domestic refinery here. I would be a little bit cautious because 20 years ago, Nigeria had this law that not one private businessman could own that much oil in that industry just because of national security concerns, right? And I think Aliko Dangote is getting a lot of political power because of this now, because he controls, he can just stop the oil immediately. He is also, I heard he wants to also sell it at kind of international prices. And if the government doesn't really comply with what he wants, he can just easily export the oil as well, because he's in the Lekki Free Trade Zone where they have an airport and a seaport. But what I'm more excited about are these small Chinese industrial parks. And I know you also had to read an article on this. Where through an interview, a local Nigerian broker who work with Chinese companies, he invited me to his village and he said, I live in this village where the local chief he set up an industrial park with Chinese and I should come visit. So I drove there for a weekend and I interviewed all the Chinese companies there and I also talked to the local chief. He invited me for tea and we just sat and chatted. And this looks like much more like a bottom up sort of win-win situation where in the '90s, a Chinese businessman, a private one came to that village and he wanted to do some fishing there. So his people they built two houses for the village chief, for his palace. 

[TEXT]
And kind of as an exchange, he was allowed to fish there and then he brought more and more people, small, private Chinese firms and they build this industrial park. And they prefer being in that small industrial park to being in the big ones because it's located on a very strategic street that goes from the south to the north and they produce mattresses and slippers and all of that and they actually also get tax benefits from the state government because the village chief talks to the state government and they also employ locals and have them not as office managers, but at least as floor managers. So there seems to be more promise here. So I wanna contrast the Nigerian case with the Ethiopian one and Ethiopia is a country in East Africa. And I'm comparing it because it is the second most populous country in Africa. So similar in size, it has never been colonized. Except for a short period of where the Italians occupied Ethiopia during the Second World War. It went through a communist era. But then what's really interesting is starting in the 1990s, where you have an authoritarian regime, arising the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. And Ethiopia also went through structural adjustment programs, but they didn't apply them one to one. They sort of like China that also went through structural adjustment, took the pieces that they felt like that would work in their country and left everything else out. So in 2002, they adopted an industrial policy strategy. And that transformed into two growth and transformations plans that are very much based on the Chinese and Korean developmental models. And when we look at Western investment flows to Ethiopia, after 2003, they have like really declined because there was sort of, the Western companies weren't able to just operate in this market anymore, because like in China it was more strategic, like some sectors were closed, some are open to foreign investment. But Chinese investments stocks meanwhile, rose a lot. And it's already ranked 11th for amount of Chinese investment stocks in Africa. And I expect it's gonna join the top 10 very soon. So when we think about growth and diversification in Ethiopia, this is a much more positive story. Although Ethiopia is also starting from a much lower level, of course, and it's much poorer than Nigeria, because it doesn't have this oil wealth. So now Ethiopia is actually the fastest growing economy in Africa right now. And it's in the news for that a lot. When we look at industrialization, this graph looks very positive, but actually when you compare over the past 20 years, the shelf industry has only grown by I believe it's 11%. And most of it is coming from construction, which is kind of the pre-stage for industrialization. So it looks promising, but we aren't there yet. And actually, we see a lot of movement from the agricultural sector towards services. So Ethiopia looks more like India now, than Korea or China, although it has this industrialization policy so. 

[TEXT]
What are some positive developments here by the Ethiopian government that were implemented? So first of all, Ethiopia has really tried to ramp up primary education enrollment over the past 10 years, and it isn't that 100% now so obviously, this isn't the perfect measure of quality education, but it's one measure to look at sort of human capital stocks and then how there's human capital growing in the economy. And as I said Ethiopia is also very strategic and has a local content initiative where some sectors are completely closed off to foreign investors. In some sectors, they are open but there are a lot of incentives for joint ventures. And even informal sort of deals. Investors are always expected to come up with a strategy and a proposal of how locals are going to benefit from this investment that is being made. However, there's the study by Blattman and Dercon, which I found very interesting. They tracked industrial workers in five different factories in Ethiopia, and actually 70% of them quit after one year. So again like there's potential in Ethiopia for industrialization, but it seems like there are more options still in the agricultural and informal sectors and people aren't really picking up these industrial jobs yet on or running with them. So I do think industrialization is happening in Ethiopia right now. But locals should be incentivized to pick up these jobs and stay for longer and they were also health concerns. So there were a bunch several blocks to move out of the way. And here's the Eastern Industry Park. And this is also one of these eight Chinese special economic zones that were placed in Africa, after China announced they want to build them in 2006. But this is a very, very different approach to what we saw in Nigeria, because this is actually a bottom up, very private initiative. So it's a private Park. And there was one Chinese businessman that came to Ethiopia in 2006. And he wanted to build a pipe factory. But then he heard about these biddings for these special economic zones. And he applied for one and he brought one of them to Ethiopia. And in the beginning, the Ethiopian government was very much against it, it was like very skeptical of what was happening there. But this private Chinese businessman, he brought government officials from Ethiopia to see the zones in China. And over a while the Ethiopian government really got into this idea of special economic zones. And in 2015, they even implemented industrial zone framework and they have four more zones planned now here and there are 83 Chinese companies operating in the zone already, although it's much smaller than the ones in Nigeria. So you have some footage from there. - [Girum] If you look for some of the best China based companies operating in Africa, chances are you'll find most in this humongous industry zone. Located about 30 kilometers outside of Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, the Eastern Industry Zone is a place for the multi faceted industries from China. - This industry is first industry in Ethiopia. 

[TEXT]
And this industry is a wide stage for the foreign investor. And this one is we get support from both of Ethiopia and China government, because they know in China government, we have the experience, how to build these industries, and how important to attract the foreign investor. Also now Ethiopia, they want to develop the industry. And now they know. - [Girum] Since its inception seven years ago, the Eastern Industry Zone has been showcasing Chinese industrial developments positive impact here. The zone now houses best Chinese manufacturers such as Huazhan Shoes and Lifan Motors. Here there is already a conducive environment for any investor to operate. And that according to the management of the Eastern Industry Zone is key. - Now Ethiopian they give good condition. They support us like one stop surveys, like the customers credit lines, inside industries, they give good service very easy. And the here is peaceful. - Now the future equally matters for Ethiopia's manufacturing sector. There is already a big ambition to make the nation Africa's manufacturing hub. For that Ethiopia eyes the new Belt and Road Initiative to make all the dreams a reality. - So actually there have been a few academic studies done on the zone. And what they found was that actually companies are training locals. Because as I said, the Ethiopian government sort of informally requires that you come up with a proposal on how locals benefit. It isn't like for the entire zone, that there's one sort of strategy so I think that could be one improvement here, but at least you see some development. That's the locals are being trained and that local human stocks of capital are going up. So I wanna make a final point here on sort of what's in it for foreign investors on obeying with local participation requirements. And I wanna talk about the state of emergency in Ethiopia. I was actually there during that time. And basically the state of emergency broke out after the Ethiopian government wanted to expand the borders of Addis Ababa, the capital to the south to have like an industrial kind of area there and protests broke out in the Oromo and Amhara regions, and it cost them ethnic tensions, and a lot of protests and arrests, et cetera. And during these protests, locals really went to foreign companies and destroyed them because they felt like they weren't part of this growth story that Ethiopia was telling them and also you could hear in Western media. So I had a very interesting story from an interviewee there that there was Aliko Dangote, which is the richest man of Africa had one factory there. And right next to it was a Dutch South African factory. And what's really interesting is the protesters walked around the Dutch South African factory and destroyed Aliko Dangote's factory. Why? Because the Dutch South African factory, they employed a lot of locals, also gave them shares from the company. 

[TEXT]
It was perceived as a local project. So in some sense, if you incorporate kind of local partners, it also mediates political risks. So let's now turn over to the lessons that we can draw from these two case studies. So first of all I think the central lesson is that deal conditions matter for development outcomes. And going back to this first question that we had in beginning, like is China new colonialist? Or can it sort of put its model in Africa and then now Africa is gonna rise, I really think that this is more about African side, strategizing rather than the Chinese dictating any model, and you see that in different sort of policy environments. The Chinese are gonna act very differently as international actors are gonna act differently as well. So I think it's more sort of African agency that is going to determine whether this is a positive or a negative China-Africa story. I also doubt that there's one China-Africa story, because we have 54 different African countries, but very different policies. And the conventional wisdom here is actually on these two conditions that African countries can't set them because they have to be deal takers in order to attract any kind of foreign capital. And this is very much this Washington Consensus Narrative, the Poverty Trap Narrative, that the region historically has not been able to attract significant amounts of investment. So you have to make it as easy for foreign investors as possible to kind of attract them. This is because Africa's population is young and under educated, low stocks of human capital poor infrastructure and political risk, sort of what Jeffrey Sachs laid out in his piece. And even with China in the picture, the African countries still have no exit options to the Chinese offer, right? So it's kind of this idea of whatever the Chinese offering, you have to accept, because there's no one else who will step in and build this for you. So as I said, I conducted 10 months of field research in Africa, kind of to try to find evidence for this. And now based on the evidence that I found, I highly doubt this entire narrative. And I say that paradoxically, I believe African countries actually have significant bargaining power with China. And I think this is fundamentally based on the idea that Africa doesn't just have all these weaknesses, that the poverty trap list here, but in fact, Africa is the region in the world with the most amount of natural resources. The cheapest labor in the world and the cheapest land. And in contrast to the West, China has both willingness and capacity right now at its developmental stage, to put its money into Africa and to really get returns from these factors that look very attractive and lucrative to China here. So completely, China has massive capital surpluses as I said and it needs raw material to fuel its growth. Africa is the last region to industrialize. 

[TEXT]
So as I said, I interviewed a lot of Chinese manufacturers that are really excited about the African markets, because it's so much cheaper there to run a factory now. Africa also has export deals with the UN, the US. So actually, when they want to export goods, they don't have to pay any tariffs. So as a Chinese if you produce in Africa, it is cheaper for you and in a lot of cases. What's also interesting, I want to focus data in and I interviewed someone who is still in Nigeria and the President said that in 2016, China increased its environmental regulations in symmetric market. And in that year, you saw a lot of Chinese companies that did not want to obey with these environmental regulations to Africa because, for example Nigeria doesn't have these strict government regulations. And finally, Chinese companies also seem to be less risk averse to political instability. So you also have a lot of Chinese investments in South Sudan, for example, which is not politically very stable. So I think that Western investors are much more sensitive, they also stay to these kind of political and safety concerns. They stay a lot of urban areas, where you see a lot of Chinese in rural areas. And I think that what's the most important is that certain concerns with Western investment that limit African bargaining power, are less alien with Chinese one. So first of all, you could argue that because China is offering all these loans to Africa, it makes these African countries very dependent on China. But actually Deborah Brautigam, who is one of the leading scholars here, she wrote a lot on this and saying, the magnitude of this is really overstated. And then you see countries like Ethiopia who have taken out much more debt with China actually being more aggressive with China than others which are smaller debtors like Nigeria. Secondly, China is also really trying to compete with the West. And the number of allies matters. Also at the UN we see that UN General Assembly, these African countries on certain things they vote with China. And if you're Ghana or if you're Nigeria, you have the same vote, it's one country, one vote. So that's why China's interested in having a relationship with all these countries and economic relationship and there is the loan, trade and investment. And I think this is very important for the central point here that these African countries, there's less of a need for intercontinental competition for Chinese investments because it seems less rivalrous than what's coming from the West. And even if China's the only sort of investor here, China oftentimes prefers to be in your economy, than not be in your economy. Even if they have to adapt slightly to policies that countries imposing and you see this year, you see investment stocks from the US where like you have maybe five countries where the top receivers and the rest is getting very little. And there's a lot of competition here for US investment. 

[TEXT]
But when you look at Chinese investment stocks in Africa, the first ones surely to get more, but then you have a much more even distribution of those investment pies, and you have 51 African countries that actually receive an investment pie. And yes, that is dependent on sort of China's political and economic considerations. But I run some regressions and it is very independent of whether African countries are imposing local participation requirements or not. And let's take one of these investment pies. Let's say Zimbabwe. And let's see what a policy shock does to these investments. So in 2008, Zimbabwe implemented this Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act, where all companies inside Zimbabwe had to have 51% of local ownership. And when we look at US investment flows here, investment stocks in Zimbabwe, you see that after 2006, they were not even counted anymore because they really decreased a lot. And I found a lot of qualitative evidence from Western companies here, complaining about 51% local ownership all of that and it just made Zimbabwe very, very uncompetitive compared to African countries. And of course, you also have the financial crisis hit here in 2008. That also is part of the story. But when you look at Chinese investment stocks here, they really don't seem to be bothered by the 51% local ownership here where you see starting in 2010, these stocks really skyrocket. So this is puzzling and then when we look at Algeria, we have the exact same policy change also in 2008, with 50% of local ownership required with companies. And here you see, starting in 2007, when these were announced it really like the curve really gets much more flat versus Chinese investment stocks. They just you have that upward sloping trend line regardless. And I also conducted a lot of interviews with Chinese businesses and Western businesses, try and get at these sensitivities, to local participation requirements. And really, across the board, when I asked the Chinese they were just like, honestly, like as I said, this is China in the '70s and '80s. And it's great here, I would stay under any kind of policy regulations. Versus when you ask a Western investor, they were like no, like if I had to employ locals, I would think about it twice. And I found this quote from Algeria as well. So the question is, why do some countries like Nigeria, Kenya, negotiate weaker deals in the sense of like, diversification issues and local participation, weaker deals with China than others like Ethiopia and Tanzania? And I think common explanations here are, for example corruption that countries know that they could be asking for more from the Chinese investors, but they aren't because politicians like to just pocket some money and let them do whatever they want. Or another explanation is ideology so that they know they could be imposing these restrictions and the Chinese would be doing it but let's just keep the economy open because we really support capitalism and let market forces do their job. 

[TEXT]
Or capacity where the government knows they could be asking for more but they don't have trained or skilled negotiators that can face sort of the Chinese negotiators that have more experience. But I would like to bring up a new explanation here, which is the government's perceptions on their own bargaining power matter. And why could this be one of the explanations? I mean, it isn't exactly obvious that these economies do have bargaining power, right? Like we just talked about all the weaknesses and how the Washington Consensus and the Poverty Trap Narrative really suggests that these countries are negotiating from a position of weakness. So I conducted interviews, especially very, very intensively in Nigeria, to understand how the Nigerian government thinks about Chinese companies and how Chinese companies think about the Nigerian government in terms of kind of policy sensitivity and exit thresholds and of what would be the policies that would drive the Chinese out. And the Nigerian government I interviewed national ministers who told me honestly, we have no bargaining power here. The Chinese and the West, they're bringing all the money and we have nothing to offer. So we kind of just have let them do whatever they want to, versus with the Chinese companies, as I said, I got a lot of them just said, you know, I would do everything to be able to stay here. And in other countries like Tanzania, there was much more of this awareness, this China really needs us. And then Ethiopia I've heard that a lot like we are really pulling the Chinese in here right now because we have cheap labor and we have cheap land. And this is exactly what China is looking for right now. So what are the factors that influence African governments' perceptions on bargaining power? And I tried to understand the political economy behind this. So first of all, I think the historic relationship to the West versus the East matters to where I said, Nigeria was a British colony for a very long time. And we went through the Washington Consensus and really adapted what Western investors were telling Nigeria at that time, versus Ethiopia had never been colonized. Tanzania also has a very long historical relationship with China. They've looked very much more towards the East also during the Cold War. There is also federalism and ministry constellation where in Nigeria, a lot of different states, they actually compete for investments. So they're not likely to share information, how much Chinese investment is actually coming in. And a lot of them really underestimated Nigeria's position and attractiveness to China. And it's the same with ministry constellation, where in Nigeria you have a lot of ministries sort of competing for these deals, and there's not one collaborative effort versus when you have one sort of very centralized government. That government has all the information on sort of what investment comes in. And it's also overtime learning if you have one party in power for a long time, they might have tested out kind of what can we asked for also more informal deals. 

[TEXT]
And then finally individual agency also matters, where I've just met people, for example in Tanzania, someone in a very senior position in the ministry. He was educated in Japan, and just really studied industrial policy through and through. And he just knew, he was very confident that China was going to obey by these rules if Tanzania asked for them. And Tanzania also has similar policies to Ethiopia. So what are some policy implications here? I just think incentives are more effective than requirements. Mostly because when you look at these different graphs from the West and China, you're trying to attract two different kinds and types of investors. So if you offer like a menu like Ethiopia has here, different types of investors can pick whatever they like the most. So if I care more about low taxes, maybe I'm more willing to have a joint venture and so forth. So you can kind of mix up different policies and offer a different menu to different types of investors that can pick whatever they wanna do. I think because these countries also have weak formal policies, it leaves room for a case-by-case negotiations as we see, for example, with these industrial parks that I talked about. The hidden industrial parks of the villages that kind of set up a deal that work for all sides. And you should also account for enter and exit thresholds where I think the decision of companies to enter your country, are probably, they're more sensitive to kind of your policy environment rather than if you're already in the country. And then certainly, you have to pay higher taxes. So your decision to exit because you already set up kind of a factory, et cetera. It's gonna be less sensitive than if you still need to put in all the capital in the beginning. So what are some expectations for the future? So I think there's certain things to consider on the Chinese side. Which is can China maintain its growth but I also heard that because China's growth is slowing now all these Chinese manufacturers are moving to Africa in search for new opportunities, and they feel like the African region is the next one to industrialize. So it's kind of, literature here is not clear whether China slowing its growth, is actually good or bad for the African region. How its rivalry will play out with the US. And what about automation and the flying geese. So I think that's something we should be concerned about that if labor is being replaced with machines, maybe the cheap labor in Africa is gonna be less needed. So factors on the African side, I think the biggest question is, can countries start to use their bargaining power and negotiate stronger deals? And just coming up with a strategy, I think here is essential, rather than just leaving the entire economy open and letting investors do whatever they want. Sort of what China did when it was poor and agricultural. 

[TEXT]
It did come up with a strategy that propelled up the economy. And I think this is interesting on debts and trade, because as I said, at the former China-Africa cooperation in 2008, African countries already complained that there was an in trade imbalance between China and Africa and that China should also import more from the African region. So it seems like around debts and trade, there is more of an awareness that this relationship should be more equal. And I hope that investments also are going into the right direction. So just to close, I brought you this comparison here again, which shows very nicely, China's economic growth miracle. And what I find really interesting here is that in the '80s, it was really the West investing in China and doing a lot of trade with China, but we still don't call it the West in China, how we call China in Africa today. And this is because China took some lessons from other countries in the past, like some of the structural adjustment, it's liked and implemented others, it came up with the zones model, which was the state capitalism. And I think similarly, the African region also can just copy and paste one model from China now or from the West, but it should strategize and see sort of what fits to local realities and the common narrative here has always been that the African region can't afford to strategize because otherwise you can't really attract foreign investment to grow. But I think because Africa is the region that has the highest stocks of raw material in the world, the cheapest labor right now and the cheapest land, I do think that there's some leverage here for the African region. And hopefully in the future, we can recolor this map and the African region can catch up with China. Thank you.

[SUMM]
The first central question is, is China a new colonialist? Or is this presence adding to local development on the ground in Africa? And are the final colonialists here by a foreign power that tries to take partial or complete political control over another nation, as well as engages in economic exploitation? Then the second central question is how does China's presence add to institutional development? So sort of more on the political side. So the question is, why do some countries like Nigeria, Kenya, negotiate weaker deals in the sense of like, diversification issues and local participation, weaker deals with China than others like Ethiopia and Tanzania? Ther are some common explanations here, for example corruption that countries know that they could be asking for more from the Chinese investors, but they aren't because politicians like to just pocket some money and let them do whatever they want.

Welcome to this Hillsdale College online course called Constitution 101 my Constitution we of course mean the greatest and longest living of all the constitutions in history the Constitution the United States we study that here because we're mindful of the fact and always have been at Hillsdale that we are citizens and we need our freedom in order to live well and do our work especially the work of a college which radically depends upon freedom of every kind we teach the Constitution to every student here at the college and now we're going to help you learn something about it the other people who are teaching in this are members of our politics faculty I'm a member of that faculty myself and among them all they may have the most knowledge of the meaning of the Constitution and the significance of the changes that have gone on around it and so it should be a privilege for you to watch this and I hope you enjoy it and I hope you read and continue learning about this for as long as you live and teach others to so much I'll explain depends on that there are a lot of details in this course details of how exactly things work and why they work the tales of different understandings than the one that prevails here about those things and so that will involve us in some complications and it'll be helpful I think that we can keep the kind of general points in mind and I'm going to name some of those today in my lecture my first question I'll ask myself and you is what kind of thing are the Declaration of Independence in the Constitution turns out the answer to that is very enriching they're different documents there's an argument that they're opposed there's a powerful argument in the historical scholarship that the Declaration was meant to be a radical document and the Constitution was meant to be conservative and that those people argue that the Declaration is about the rights of us all and the Constitution is really about protecting the privileged well we we think that's nonsense around here and even on its face it's nonsense for one reason at the time exact time the difference independence is from 1776 and the Constitution's from 1787 so they're close together but nevermind there are all kinds of state constitutions written at the same time as the Declaration of Independence some of them signed by people who also signed the Declaration of Independence and they're all like the Constitution the United States in in their structure which I'm going to talk about something that's important so another thing about it is that strikes me as particularly silly I've written a book about this is if you read the Declaration of Independence you will find that it comes in three parts and in the first part it states some universal principles very beautiful and in the second part it contains a bill of particulars in seventeen paragraphs about bad stuff the King of England did which bad stuff justifies the making of America throwing off the old government and adopting a new one and those things are remarkably like the Constitution 

[TEXT]
United States what did the King do wrong well he interfered with the legislature which is a violation of the first step in all government the making of laws but also a violation of separation of powers which is crucial to how the Constitution United States worked so separation of powers is important and then he interfered with the people's ability to elect legislatures in other words representation a key feature of the Constitution of the United States and then he interfered with the judges he would ship people arrest them for crimes and ship them off to England where they couldn't be tried by a jury of their peers nor before judges who are independent of the executive branch which more or less the king was so you see they're writing the Constitution right there if you have a government that does these things then you are justified to rebel against that government and to kill anybody who resists you so it implies the Constitution now what kind of thing that they are different to that Christ Independence and the Constitution they serve different functions they also sound different in a very interesting way the difference independence is really beautiful you know when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands that have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature's God entitle them in that a grand expression the laws of nature and of nature's God it's written like that also it's not time bound when in the course of human events that means anytime in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people that means any people anywhere anytime the claim is what's gonna follow in this document is right at all times and so one way to think about the difference between the Declaration and the Constitution is it's a document about ultimate purposes what they call in classic philosophy final causes final causes are the things that we seek above all others the things we would die for and so the representor pence states those and of course those words echo around the world still today even when they're distorted you're gonna learn something about that in this course well the constitution is not quite like that the Constitution is it provides a form of government and when you read it hey you know I've regarded it as beautiful and think I understand why it's beautiful it has to do with its structure which Madison says is the most important thing about it but you know on any given passage right it's full of details like there's a list in article 1 section 8 things that Congress can do well post offices and post roads is among them 

[TEXT]
it's hard to write a beautiful sentence about that no this is a document about how the government is going to work even how it's going to look it looks like a thing that operates in three branches if the if there's a interviews going on in front of the White House which there are everyday on the nightly news there's a picture of the White House in the background because that's where the president works and that's where executive things are done and if there's a if there's something big in the Congress then there's cameras looking up at the Capitol dome because that's where the Congress operates and where the legislation is made and the same for the Supreme Court building in operation the government looks like the Constitution and sure enough the first three articles in the Constitution one of them the first one sets up the legislative branch beginning with the words all legislative power herein granted and one thing you're going to learn in this course is that we don't make our laws through the Congress anymore that's why there can be so many of them and that's why it's impossible to hold to account those who make them except very indirectly and did it's even hard to find out who makes them I think there are a hundred and fifty lawmaking agencies in the federal government now so each of those clauses establish one two three the way the government of the United States looks and so if you think about it you couldn't have any serious activity that did not have a final cause a whole bunch of people cooperating sometimes it risks to their lives suffering and trouble sacrifice that started right at the beginning because the first thing that happened after the Detroits a dependence was we well actually it already happened a bit before we're having a war with England the greatest power on earth and to undertake that you need a big reason you need some ultimate reason and any time people think of their deaths they always think of what they live their lives for that's what the Declaration I'm in Independence is but then on the other hand if you're actually going to have a great government then there's gonna have to be ways for it to operate cuz think what it has to achieve it has to grant power the doctrine of the Detroits independence is that all legitimate power stems from those who are governed no other source but then somehow you've got to get some way to get legitimacy into the things that the government does and have that operate on a routine basis so if you're gonna have a legitimate government you're gonna have a form a recognized way by which it operates and so the Constitution provides that one you could say is the final cause and the other is the formal cause now I'm going to back up a step and ask a question that's prevalent today and that is why should you have any government at all

what do you need it for and then we were just over in England as we're making this course and we were celebrating the completion of the official biography of Winston Churchill and there was a couple of young English guys who were working and helping us get around and they were delightful people and I got into long talks with them and they just made the point cuz you know they're having the big debate about whether they separate from the European Union over there or not and that young as a rule don't favor the separation and they said well we're not English we're European and I said dad what if you don't like something the European Union does oh there's a lot we don't like we want to see it reformed and I said good what means do you have to achieve that reform because it's kind of difficult isn't it there's 29 countries I think aren't they they don't all speak the same language how would you have a conversation with a wide body of fellow citizens to establish a thing like major reforms to the government and that's a point isn't it because in the Constitution well in the place in the Federalist Papers which are assigned to read along with this course and I urge you to read them and reread them because they're a great achievement in political thought one of the greatest and one of the greatest American such achievements and in the 51st Federalist Madison explaining why you have to build a constitution that that has precautions in it it has to grant power you have to have that but also it has to constrain power you have to have that and the way he puts the point is what is government but the profoundest of all reflections on human nature if men were angels no government will be necessary if angels were to govern men neither internal or external controls on the government would be needed see what that means he's locating us in the hierarchy of nature down at the bottom of the beasts are the rocks and up at the top are angels and God and if angels were being of being governed although there's a record in the Bible that their behavior is not perfect still it's true that is a common run is probably a lot better than ours and they don't they're imagined as as disembodied intellects and so they don't have all the needs and pressures we have and the beasts they just always obey instinct whereas we're moral beings which means we're called to do right and we don't always and that is actually the reason why we need laws but Madison just makes the common sense points the people who make the laws are people too how do we know they won't make them in their own interest well you need a constitution and it needs to be in control of the governed and so the reason nations 

[TEXT]
and that word nation a comes from the Latin word not hora which means nature and that means that the making of laws is written in human nature and it actually precedes Aristotle says from our ability to talk because the that's a pregnant thing about us that's the big thing about us and so this need for government is fundamental and on the other hand we need to be able to control it and Nations therefore are conceived as natural things where people can understand each other they say they share a common final cause as in the Declaration of Independence which tells us what our nation is for and then they can cooperate with each other to a point and manage a government that responds to their will so it's actually true then isn't it that in this age where we rescuing nationalism for internationalism the detrás independence talks about that and mark the point I've already made it the pursue dependence begins universally it says that everybody has rights every human being the same in every age no matter where and then it says that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed in other words this universal rights that we have they call for government to protect those rights and they call for a kind of government that will be responsive to us it's a remarkable thing I think it's hard to quarrel with the assertion which I make all the time that the greatest of the modern countries is the United States of America well its story is tremendous right because it begins with a new world nobody knew where it was nobody knew what it was until about 18 6 I think it was nobody really knew how big it was nobody gone across the new world and all the way back until about then Lewis and Clark so something happened on this new land and what was it they picked up a civilization it's like in the western movies you know they're often a contest between somebody who's got a law book and somebody who's got a gun and in the towns where the westerns take place there's no capacity at all to produce either a law book or a gun but they know about them because they've come from a well developed civilization and brought it out to the frontier that's what the whole Western movies are just recreations of American history because the civilization mostly of Europe with its understanding of God and its understanding of right and it's learning and its understanding of nature that comes over here and those people brought all that in their minds and hearts what they didn't bring was aristocracy they didn't bring an established elite to run everything what they brought instead was ideas of freedom and equality and so there was this new world and a bunch of people got to take it over and they had because you know the first settlements are about a hundred and fifty years before the Declaration of Independence 

[TEXT]
and that 150 years was a time of great learning one of the most remarkable things that was learned was that most of the early settlers came because of religious persecution and they thought the solution to that was to set up communities where their religion was installed by law and protected and everybody had to practice it and they thought it's a big old country if somebody doesn't like it they can go somewhere else so religious conformity was more or less the rule early on though the idea came to be we don't really have to fight about that first of all we do find a lot about it they were they used to in Massachusetts Bay Colony they used to hang Quakers for coming to town to try to convert people to Quakerism and Quakers or Christians you know different brand and so they thought that through and in the course of that hundred and fifty years they adopted the idea of civil and religious freedom and that's in the deck Royce of Independence right because life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that has to do including with our duty to God and so that religion should be respected but also free that's born that's reaches its perfection in the Declaration of Independence god I should say occurs four times in the Declaration of Independence and it's an interesting thing because it it demonstrates the way they talk of him how important God is and it demonstrates also how important limited government is because God appears first is the maker of the laws of nature nature's God the legislator then he appears as the supreme judge of the world the judge and then he appears as divine providence the executive branch and then he appears up higher up in as the creator or the founder of all things right and the lesson of the difference of Independence is one God is a standard greatly to be respected and worshipped and understood but - you wouldn't combine all those powers in the hand of any any being except God not for men so you see this tremendous opportunity which I can't see myself how would ever be repeated in history because there isn't a new world anymore maybe space but there's nowhere to go like that anymore and so they went there and they got a fifty years to work on it and then they proclaimed a regime defined by these two documents that's one of the most important events in human history in my opinion I say a thing or two about the Constitution because that's important first of all I mentioned that it's divided into groups and there are seven articles in the Constitution United States and the first three set up the three branches of government but then a second thing about it's interesting and that is that it's not an unlimited government there's something called the police power which comes from English common law very old and it's the general authority 

[TEXT]
to legislate for the health safety and welfare of the people state governments in America I have that and that means that if the state if a state government tries to do something you know there are provisions and state constitutions and in the Federal Constitution that forbid them to do many things but the presumption is they have the power to do it if it fits within that common law definition which is very wide whereas the Constitution the United States delegates certain powers to the federal government and just think what a different thing in kind that is like Hillsdale College has Articles of Incorporation and they're very beautiful by the way and we follow them here closely but when it comes to the operation of the colleges it basically grants us the board and me and the staff here power to do anything a college needs to do well the federal grammar is not like that the federal government has article one section eight and and that's a limit on the government you see the the clauses are it's not hard to state what they're about is about National Defense the big job of the federal government the second biggest group is provisions to guarantee a system of national Commerce all over the nation one nation as regards economics contracts are to be respected bankruptcy there's to be a provision for them so that you have to be a legal process before you can get out of your debts but there should be such a process money weights and measures it's gonna be a great nation trading freely inside its borders and that will make the nation strong and nations need to be strong in order to defend themselves and the only other things that are powers given to the federal government are basically to operate in the States on the ground where the federal government has installations so the post office is Federal Territory and the Federal Building there way too many of those now but there's a provision for them right from the beginning so it's a limited government and whatever it does it has to justify by a specific provision in the Constitution that permits it and that's not the strictest rule in the world you know there's leeway but but it's a different kind of thing than to begin on the basis you can do whatever you please the last thing I'll say about the Constitution is what's it trying to do we like to say today if we're conservative minded people which I happen to be that the Constitution is to limit the government but of course that's obviously not true the first thing in this is in power of the government and it's it's all over the Constitution and the documents surrounding it that everybody understood they need a strong government in fact the Constitution itself which replace the Articles of Confederation was written in part because the Articles were failing and the reason they were failing was the government wasn't strong enough to protect our rights 

[TEXT]
there were foreign troops on our soil and we couldn't do anything about it couldn't pay our debts they were riots in the States and they couldn't be put down Madison writes all this up in a really great essay before the Constitutional Convention called vices of the political system of the United States it's in our Constitution reader and so they need a stronger government but they divide it now what is the purpose of the division and you have to think about how profound the division is although it's been much overcome by the growth of the administrative state and the bureaucracy which you're going to hear a lot about in this course it's still true that it's a it's a tremendous achievement because in dividing the powers they arranged for different methods of election of the different parts so the president serves for four years the house representatives serves for two the Senate serves for six the judges are appointed by the President on advice of the Senate the constituencies are different the constituency for a senator is a state the constituency for the president is an electoral college made up of they which you win by majority that's under pressure these days which you win by majority of the electors in in the states and the electors are calculated according to the number of Senators and Representatives each state has so you see what it does it spreads Authority across space and you remember this is the greatest and most extensive Republic in human history and they were trying to unite a continent the full size of which they did not quite know yet although George Washington did name his army the Continental Army so they wanted spread and so the Senate spreads political authority and that means people who live in the very different and widely separated parts of the country all get a say even if they're not very numerous and then on the other hand it spreads Authority across time because if you want to change something in the American government the fastest you can possibly turn the whole government is six years because it takes three elections to elect a whole Senate and the president 2/3 of that amount of time so that means that it places a premium on opinions that we hold firmly and for a long time and Madison makes this point beautifully in the Federalist Papers and more than once in the 49th I think it is he says it is our reason alone that must be placed in control of the government our passions must be controlled by it so we're supposed to think before we act here's another feature of the Constitution in the 63rd Federalist Madison says that this is the first purely representative government in history he's claiming a uniqueness and what does he mean by purely representative he means that sovereign sovereign in England was the king and he was the executive branch the sovereign sovereign in Athens was the free citizens and they were the legislative branch sovereignty the sovereign in America is the constitutional majority but they don't occupy a branch of government we don't control I mean they've introduced the referendum things like that in later years 

[TEXT]
but there's no federal referendum process why Madison thought it would be good for us because you know just like you can't trust the government fully because they're people you can't trust us fully either because we're people too and so we can only act through elections that makes elections important in America and it also means we can't do anything by the spur of the moment the best decisions not being made on the spur of the moment and our state of telling exception to that too the president is specifically empowered to act alone and that's in matters of execution think of the different meanings of that term execution when you've got a war you to act suddenly but laws prevail because of course if the president starts a war and the Congress doesn't like it or if he sends a bunch of troops somewhere they don't have to supply any money for that and the money will run out if they will put a stop to it and they have often in American history and threatened other times so you see the idea is that we have all the power but we can't act except through our representatives and that adds patients and and deliberation to the process and then a last thing the size of the of the United States the fact that it's spread so far the fact that it includes so many people in so many jurisdictions you know the states are supposed to have a lot more authority than they have these days and one of my wishes is to see it restored a lot of other things like that too but when it's spread all over the place let's say you've got ten little conspiratorial friends you know you can if you got ten little conspiratorial friends you can meet in dark rooms and whisper to each other and nobody need find out but what's ten gonna do in a country this says in fact to influence the country you have to cry you have to talk across millions of people hundreds of thousands in the founding millions now tens of millions now and you have to you have to speak across vast spaces and Madison rights that will teach us to be more candid with each other we you know we we love to say that all politicians are liars and I think that's not quite true but it's a rough truth but on the other end think how much worse it would be if they didn't have to talk in front of us and if they weren't free to contradict each other and I

I want to close with this point because it's fundamentally important there are just two ways of governing human beings and one is by talking and the others by force because we are the speaking beings this rationality that we have that lets us use common nouns that's what makes us political and so legitimate political systems are always built on talking not on violence they may take violence to install they may require violence to persist than to defend but they must not proceed in their ordinary workings by violence of one citizen upon another and so we have a political system that first of all is met to potat protect our rights which are written in our nature the decisive part of which is our ability to reason and talk but also we have a nation where we're supposed to discuss things and teach each other and learn from each other and I'll go back to the European Union the poles and the Czechs and the English and the French don't really have a good way to talk to each other except through the agencies of the European Union and that means it's very difficult for there to be a culture in which public opinion is formed freely among all of the people who are affected they can't speak with each other routinely their translation programs and lots of people speak more than one language in Europe and yet to talk in your native tongue the tongue in which you've been educated and by which you articulate your best thoughts that's what you do especially with fellow citizens it's become a very great country in the course of its history beyond the imaginings even of the people who founded it who were extremely ambitious people they had the highest possible hopes all right well if that's true there must have been some cause of it but also it's in that final purpose we serve that we have adopted it's a purpose available to all human beings we have adopted it for our own and then finally in this form of government we have under the Constitution which is itself a reflection of human nature and that is why it has worked so well so I'll close with the editorial point well known I think we are doing restore the authority of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence thank you.

[SUMM]
If you have a government that does these things, then you are justified to rebel against that government and to kill anybody who resists you. Government is divided into groups and there are seven articles in the Constitution, United States and the first three set up the three branches of government. If it fits within that common law definition, which is very wide, whereas the Constitution, the United States delegates certain powers to the federal government and just think what a different thing in kind that is like Hillsdale College - has Articles of Incorporation and they're very beautiful. The federal government has article one section, eight and and that's a limit on the government. The Constitution itself, which replace the Articles of Confederation was written in part because the Articles were failing and the reason they were failing was the government wasn't strong enough to protect our rights.
