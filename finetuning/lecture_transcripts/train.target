There are schools of psychology that made it what it is today. The Structuralists were one of the first groups to study psychology. The major players in this schoool were Wundt and Titchner. They focused on breaking complex ideas into simple ones. However, this model failed when applied to abstract and varying concepts such as love. 
The second school of psychology was the Gestalt School. The major players in this school were Kohler, Werner, Kofka and Wertheimer. This school disagreed that complex things could be broken into simple things. The Gestalts said the problem with the Structuralists is that you lose meaning when breaking elements down. They believed the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The Gestaults had major influences on other areas of psychology in the future. 
The Radical Behaviorists came out of the Behaviorist School. The Radical Behaviorists are also called Neobehaviorists. Some major players were Skinner, Estes, Premack, and many others. Neobahaviorists focused on consequences of behavior. They had huge impacts in all areas of psychology and in areas such as education and business. Another group called the Modeling School came out of the Behaviorists. A major player was Bandura. They believed that a lot of learning we do occurs through observing other things or observing other people. 
The Cognitive Learning Behaviorist School also came out of the Behaviorist School. They emphasize the internal processes of behavior. The problem with their cognitive models is they often use correlational data to make causal inferences. Also, concentrating on the mind and not behavior doesn't always work. The major players were Chomsky, Broadbent, Craik, and many others. This school made major impacts in how the mind works. We will be talking about these major schools of psychology. We will focus within the traditional learning models from the late 1800s through the present. 
The second variable that relates to cognitive control is self-efficacy which is defined as the belief that you have in your own ability. Individuals with high self-efficacy believe that they can succeed at anything, and individuals with low self-efficacy believe that they can't succeed at anything. The third variable is expectancy which relates to what your expectation about what will happen in a particular situation. Expectation about what will happen is the most important thing studied by these cognitive learning theorists. 
The fourth variable that's examined is the personality variables. The first personality variable is called agreeableness. This is different from extroversion and introversion types of personality variables which relate to how talkative and social individuals are. Consciousness is another personality variable. It is how ethical, dependable, productive, and purposeful you are within a particular environment. The next is neuroticism which is anxiousness, insecurity, guilt-proneness, and self-consciousness.
