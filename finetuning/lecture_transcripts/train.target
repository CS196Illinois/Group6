The next factor that will influence memory relates to what we call organization. In clustering, basically you recall items better if you can recognize that there are two or more types of things in a particular list. Now there are other verbal pneumonic techniques as well. The same occurs with the second list that is located on the right hand side of page six. You learn sociology then you learn psychology. In this section, what we’re going to do is discuss some factors that influence memory. Let’s say that I give you the first list; north, cardinal, south, robin, east, wren, west, sparrow. There are lots of different types of organizational strategies and I’ve listed those on slide four. This is a classic way to help when one is taking comprehensive finals later in the semester. So let’s begin by talking about the first organizational strategy called clustering and is located on page five. Thus what you have is recalling of recency effect items. In verbal pneumonic techniques, you make your own organization and there are many, many different types of techniques. Proactive - You learn A, you learn B, then you recall B. These examples are shown in slide six. In general, if you can organize material, you can recall it better. So when you study for exam one and after you really know it all, you continue to study it. When you can recall it perfectly, you continue to study it. That is called the Serial Position Effect. So you study some particular topic whatever that topic is. The next one of these, as we see on slide seven, are what are called verbal pneumonic techniques. So let’s do that by beginning with the concept on slide two, and that concept is overlearning. If you have problems doing that, participate in a test anxiety workshop. Let’s say that you’re learning psychology, (ala learning) and you’re going to take a test. So now we’ve examined a variety of different verbal pneumonic techniques and how they work. Another verbal pneumonic technique is shown on slide 11 and called Rhymes. There are a variety of different acrostics that one uses. Basically in overlearning, the idea is that you continue to study something after you can recall it perfectly. Now if you can recognize that north, south, east and west are points on a compass and cardinal, robin, wren and sparrow are birds, then you have a higher probability of recalling that material than if you just tried to recall the list in order. Let’s give an example, if you learn list A, then you learn list B, and finally you have to recall B. That is a classic acronym PABB. 
So the memory that you have is in neither in short term memory or long term memory. In this section we examine a variety of different brain structures that are involved with memory. The first major structure that’s involved with memory is what is called the Hippocampus, and the Hippocampus plays a major role in encoding and storing information. However, your old information remains intact. When you damage the Hippocampus, you have problems with storing and recall. He then lesioned the area that disrupted the eye blink response. As a result, he found that the leg response was affected but the eye blink response was not. Within short term memory, we are processing information. 
Thus a four item multiple choice exam for each question is much easier than an eight item multiple choice exam. That is, memory traces decay as time passes. So let’s start talking about the first of these theories called decay theory. Basically, happy words with sad music or sad words with happy music had poor recall. Decay theory, as we see in slide three, is very straightforward. Again, interference theory talks about retrograde interference and proactive interference. The problem is there is little evidence to support decay theory. These are called flashbulb memories. In general what happens say these theorists is that we have different retrieval cues. The theory contends that memory traces are lost as other memory traces occur before and after the stimulus is present. Explicit memories are basically things that we are consciously aware of when we retrieve them, while implicit memories are memories of experiences you cannot consciously retrieve. The first is what is called reconstructive memory. Well, as we see in slide four, it is called interference theory. So, happy moods with happy music and sad words with sad music got better recall than when they were mixed. So what’s the second type of theory?In this section we begin to talk about the last aspect of memory and that is retrieval, forgetting, and recall. What happens?” There are many, many different types of theories to answer these questions and listed here. Basically the classic study is by Easterbrook. Eich and Metcalf studied subjects when they were recalled happy or sad words listening to happy or sad music. It relates to what we call retrieval cues. 
Different cultures often have entirely different perceptions of time. Polychronic cultures view time as being somewhat flexible. The cultural anthropologist Edward T. Hall popularized the idea that cultures use time and view time in very different ways. The same diversity among individuals might be found in a primarily monochronic culture. In addition, interpersonal relationships are highly valued in polychronic cultures. In Hall’s 1990 book The Dance of Life, Hall writes, “Time is one of the fundamental bases on which all cultures rest and around which all activities revolve. The idea of the past, present, and future—and the whole concept of scheduling or managing time—can be so different that it leads to cross-cultural miscommunications. These cultures emphasize schedules, punctuality, and preciseness. Traditional time management programs in the business world emphasize to-do lists and careful scheduling. On the other hand, polychronic time is characterized by many things happening simultaneously. To a monochronic culture, this type of schedule is valued over interpersonal relationships. The idea of being late versus on time for a meeting, for example, might differ widely between an American businessperson and a Brazilian; the American businessperson might be far less tolerant of a Brazilian’s late arrival. Edward Hall’s theory of monochronic and polychronic cultures has been challenged by some critics. Critics of anthropologists like Edward Hall feel that it’s more useful to think of time differences among individuals, not just between cultural groups. Some traditional time management programs used in the business world might not translate well in another culture. There is more value placed on “being” than on “doing. ” Different cultural perceptions of time can lead to conflict, especially in the business world. Polychronic time, on the other hand, can be found primarily in Latin American, African, and Native American cultures. They also emphasize “doing” things. In other words, a primarily polychronic culture might have both monochronic and polychronic types of people. Monochronic time is linear. 
Nor is a social inventor a social contributor; a social contributor might be someone who supports social causes financially, or emotionally. They make people think, on some level, about what a society needs in order to survive. A social inventor is not necessarily a social activist. Not just basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter, but deeper needs, relating to the health and values of society. The social critic John Ralston Saul reminds us of how the Greeks constructed both new styles of buildings and new structures of civilization. How important is it for people to contribute to society in some way?An activist fights for social change. Social inventions do not have to be organizations, however. The idea of social inventions or social ingenuity has become so popular in recent years that “Idea Banks” of social inventions have shown up on the World Wide Web, books have been published on the subject, and Institutes have been founded. Tragedies have a way of making people rethink their values and find a new focus. However, this way of thinking changed, arguably, with the rise of the great city of Athens. Some examples of social inventions may sound familiar to you. And finally, a social inventor is not necessarily someone who works in a high-tech industry or invents new technologies and consumer products. Now millions of people around the world write letters to protest human rights violations. The Institute for Social Inventions, based in London, connects think tanks and idea banks throughout Europe. A British lawyer named Peter Benenson wrote an editorial after two Portuguese studentswere imprisoned for toasting freedom in a café, and the international organization to support human rights began. For example, some movie theatres in Boston and New York have recently started implementing a social invention to solve the problem of babies crying in movie theatres. After the tragedy of 9/11, some people have become preoccupied with this question. According to John Ralston Saul, the notion of “fate” returned with new faces— globalization, the market, or even technology. Social inventors have a vision of a better world and create new systems or practices. People in Western society began to feel powerless in the face of these large, looming forces that were shaping our society for us. Their thinking changed, in other words, from a passive approach to an active one. Most social inventors are not famous or wealthy because of their inventions. What was fated to happen was going to happen, and there was nothing that they could do about it. Perhaps somewhere in the late 20th century we began to lose sight of this active way of thinking. 
Personal stressors are major life events that create stress. Cataclysmic events are major events that cause stress suddenly, immediately, for a great many people at once. We may experience different levels of stress depending on the stressors, meaning the events or circumstances that cause us to feel stress. In general, though, stressful events can be classified into three main categories: cataclysmic events, personal stressors, and background stressors. Of course, not everyone perceives the same events or circumstances as stressful; we don’t always react the same way to the same stressors. Stress, broadly defined, is our response to events that we perceive as threatening or challenging. Everyone experiences stress on some level every day. This is useful in some situations, especially where we might actually need to defend ourselves. Biologically, our bodies may react with such symptoms as aches and pains, fatigue, or illnesses. They are not always events that we would perceive as negative; many “joyful” life events can also cause a great deal of stress. For example, getting engaged or married, acquiring a new family member (through birth or adoption), starting a new job, and even taking a vacation can all be as stressful as “negative” life events. is the resistance stage, which occurs if the stressor is not removed. In the long run, though, this activation of what is known as the sympathetic nervous system has negative effects and reduces our capacity to manage stress. When stress hormones are constantly secreted, and the body is continually preparing for emergencies, body tissues such as the heart and blood vessels can begin to deteriorate. Interestingly, the exhaustion phrase may actually be an extreme way of trying to avoid the stressors. Finally, background stressors—which we can also think of as dayto-day hassles, or minor irritations—can cause stress, particularly when they add up, when we are repeatedly exposed to them. Examples of background stressors are waiting in a long line, getting stuck in a traffic jam, being exposed to noise, experiencing a delay of some sort, or dealing with broken equipment. It is during this first phase that the sympathetic nervous system is activated and the body responds with a sense of emergency. The second phase of G. A. S.
The objectives for today are to get setup info, print hello world!, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, lists, and exception-handling. Python is a programming language. More specifically, it is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Python files have a . py extension. Object-oriented is a programming paradigm centered around the idea of using objects. Objects are abstract data types. Python is a high-level programming language. Pythonic code is a design choice to produce highly readable Python code. To create our first program, we create a . py file and run the script in bash with the command Òpython <file-name>. py>. Variables help us store stuff in programs. Dynamic typing in Python means that you donÕt need to specify a variable type. None is a variable type used as an empty placeholder. Conditionals are an incredibly powerful way to let you make decisions in your code. The operators used are Ò==Ó, Ò!=Ó, Ò<=Ó, Ò>=Ó, Ò<Ó, Ò>Ó, ÒisÓ, and ÒinÓ. If we have more than two conditions, we use the elif statement. Loops allow us to repeatedly run the same section of code. The for loop uses the range function to establish how many times the loop will be run. The range function is inclusive at the start and exclusive at the end. The ÒinÓ operator can also be used in for loops. A list is not an array. The while loop says that while some statement is true, we run the code. To leave a loop early, we use the break keyword to break out of the current loop. Functions are blocks of code we plan on reusing. There is a specific format for functions. A function will return to the code that called it once it runs, and you can use the return keyword to manually leave a function. Lists are a collection which is ordered and changeable. Lists are simply arrays of bytes. When an error occurs in our program, Python will stop and send an error message. In order to handle these, we use exception handling with the try-except commands. 
The objectives for today are to understand the review, Pythonic code, list comprehension, enumerate, sets, and dictionaries. The review covers variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and lists. Pythonic code is code that uses Python in the way it was intended to be used. Common commands and code in other languages can be condensed and made more effective in Python. Pythonic code can be used to find if something exists in an array, to find the sum of a list of numbers, etc. more effectively. Also, slicing is a useful piece of Pythonic code. List comprehensions are a classic Pythonic tool which allows you to create new lists from other lists. List comprehensions have an output expression, variable, input sequence, and an optional predicate. We can supercharge list comprehension with conditional logic. Another Pythonic tool is called enumerate which allows us to assign an index to values in a list. Enumerate is useful with loops. Now we will learn about data structures. Sets are unordered and unindexed data structures, with each value being unique. Sets are very fast when used as lookup tables. Sets have a function in ÔMathÕ sets. To initialize a set, you say your variable is equal to set(). You use the . add() with the value you want to add. Sets have faster lookup times than arrays or lists. Dictionaries are another data structure. We can access elements by referencing keys. They use key-value pairs. These are very fast when used as a lookup table. 
New England colonies had religious motives for colonization, male and female settlers, tight knit communities, and a mixed economy. The Protestant Reformation sparked dramatic changes in Europe and led to the ride of Puritanism. Puritans wanted to purify the church. The pilgrims were separatists who wanted to break away from the Anglican Church. The pilgrims sought to establish a colony and land at Plymouth. The Mayflower Compact established a basic government upon majority rule, and it established the basis of self government. The Governor was William Bradford. In 1629, Puritan John Winthrop received a charter to establish the Massachusetts Bay colony. His goal was to be a ÒCity Upon a HillÓ. Religion was extremely important in the New England colonies. Religious freedom was reserved only for Puritans. Church membership was a requirement for participation in politics, Town Hall Meeting became an important part of direct democracy in colonial America, as all church going males could participate. Roger Williams questioned Puritan leadership. He called for the complete separation of church and state and criticized the colonies treatment of Native Americans. He was banished from the colony and founded Providence, Rhode Island. This was the first colony with complete religious freedom. Anne Hutchison challenged the accepted role of women within the church by openly speaking out against church leaders. The Pequot War caused New England colonists to wipe out the Pequot tribe. The New England Confederation in 1643 was a military alliance intended to defend the New England colonies against potential threats. King PhilipÕs War happened between 1675 and 1676 and was when the leader of the Wampanoags were defeated by the colonists. This was the end of major Native resistance to the New England colonies. The Middle Colonies were the breadbasket of America. New York was originally a Dutch colony called New Amsterdam. Charles the Second sends a military expedition and grants area to his brother James the Duke of York. Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn as a refuge for Quakers. It was a very liberal colony. It treated Native Americans fairly. It practiced religious toleration and freedom. It extended rights to women. It was demographically, religiously, and ethnically diverse. Mercantilism meant that colonies were designed to enrich the mother country. The Navigation Acts established that 1. Trade carried only in English or colonial ships 2. Trade had to pass through English ports 3. Certain enumerated goods from the colonies could be exported only to England (tobacco, etc. ). Smuggling was a problem. The Dominion of New England of 1686 implemented to increase royal control over the colonies. Sir Edmund Andros was appointed by the king. He was very unpopular as he enforced the Navigation Acts and limited town meetings. 
In the New England colonies, there were Puritan religious motives for colonization. These were close-knit homogeneous society. There was an importance of religion, family, and education, as schools were required. There were Town Hall meetings. They received a large number of immigrants and a high birthrate. There was a mixed economy based on agriculture, trade, and shipbuilding. In the Southern Plantation colonies, it was male dominated society, had a warmer climate, had a harsh life, and had a lower birth rate. There was a defined hierarchy of wealth and status. These were cash crop plantation economies. Very few cities developed. The labor system moved from indentured servants to slavery. There was a transition to slavery because of an abundance of land, a shortage of indentured servants, no way to enslave the native population, and a European demand for colonial goods. The triangular trade was a 3 part trade route where slaves and goods moved from Africa, the Carribbean, and the colonies. The journey from Africa to the Western Hemisphere was known as the ÒMiddle passageÓ. Slave culture was a blend of African and American cultures based on a variety of tribes from different parts of Africa. The Stono Uprising in 1739 South Carolina was one of the few slave revolts in colonial America. They tried to get to Spanish Florida where they were promised freedom. The rebellion was defeated and contributed to stricter laws regulating slaves. Religious passion was fading in the New England colonies. The Half Way Covenant in 1662 said that individuals could become partial church members even if they did not have a conversion. The Massachussetts Bay colony did not allow freedom of religion. Some religious toleration existed in a few British colonies, as Pennsylvania had Quakers, Rhode Island had separation of church and state, and Maryland had toleration for all Christians. The Great Awakening was a religious revival in the 1730s-1740s that spread throughout the colonies. Many people convert. Jonathan Edwards delivered the speech ÒSinners in the Hands of an Angry GodÓ. George Whitefield introduced a new energized style of evangelical preaching. This saw the New Lights, who were supporters, versus Old Lights, who were against it. This led to the new universities being formed such as Dartmouth, Princeton, Brown, and more. Greater religious independence and diversity resulted, and new churches formed. This strengthened calls for the separation of church and state. This was the first mass movement shared amongst colonists. Various mercantile laws were passed to regulate colonial trade and to benefit England such as the Navigation Acts and the Molasses Act. The goals and interests of European leaders at times diverged from those of colonial citizens. Salutary neglect was defined as relative indifference to colonial governance. The good was that colonial shipbuilding developed. This provided protection of the British military. This provided Chesapeake tobacco a monopoly in England. The bad was that it restricted the development of colonial manufacturing. England attempted to integrate the colonies into a coherent, hierarchical imperial structure known as the Dominion of New England in 1686. The Glorious Revolution in 1688 led to the overthrow of James II and William and Mary take the throne. This limits the power of the monarchy. The colonists rebel against the Dominion of England. The big turning point was the end of the seven years war. Colonial politics saw the gradual development of democratic institutions in the colonies such as the Mayflower Compact and Town Hall Meetings. Many people were still excluded and England was ultimately still in charge. The Zenger Case of 1733 advanced the freedom of the press. 
These lectures deal with power and politics in today's world and by today's world, I'm gonna mean the 30 years since 1989 and the 30 years since 1989 are and have been an incredibly tumultuous period of very great change. Enormous confidence in democratic capitalism and enormous confidence in the idea that many people were gonna be lifted out of poverty and that the world was heading for a kind of benign equilibrium, as an economist would say, Fukuyama's end of history idea. Was there another path that would have been politically viable that would have led the world in a different direction. 
A little bit about Justice Scalia and what his absence from the court will mean and then shift and talk in a broader brush about what's coming for the court and what the election will mean for the court. Lots of press on the issue of the replacement of Justice Scalia. A discussion about Hillary and her policies towards guns. When choosing policies, do we go to legislators, or do we go based on what the larger group of people want. The direct representation is lacking. 
There are schools of psychology that made it what it is today. The Structuralists were one of the first groups to study psychology. The major players in this schoool were Wundt and Titchner. They focused on breaking complex ideas into simple ones. However, this model failed when applied to abstract and varying concepts such as love. 
The second school of psychology was the Gestalt School. The major players in this school were Kohler, Werner, Kofka and Wertheimer. This school disagreed that complex things could be broken into simple things. The Gestalts said the problem with the Structuralists is that you lose meaning when breaking elements down. They believed the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The Gestaults had major influences on other areas of psychology in the future. 
The Radical Behaviorists came out of the Behaviorist School. The Radical Behaviorists are also called Neobehaviorists. Some major players were Skinner, Estes, Premack, and many others. Neobahaviorists focused on consequences of behavior. They had huge impacts in all areas of psychology and in areas such as education and business. Another group called the Modeling School came out of the Behaviorists. A major player was Bandura. They believed that a lot of learning we do occurs through observing other things or observing other people. 
The Cognitive Learning Behaviorist School also came out of the Behaviorist School. They emphasize the internal processes of behavior. The problem with their cognitive models is they often use correlational data to make causal inferences. Also, concentrating on the mind and not behavior doesn't always work. The major players were Chomsky, Broadbent, Craik, and many others. This school made major impacts in how the mind works. We will be talking about these major schools of psychology. We will focus within the traditional learning models from the late 1800s through the present. 
The second variable that relates to cognitive control is self-efficacy which is defined as the belief that you have in your own ability. Individuals with high self-efficacy believe that they can succeed at anything, and individuals with low self-efficacy believe that they can't succeed at anything. The third variable is expectancy which relates to what your expectation about what will happen in a particular situation. Expectation about what will happen is the most important thing studied by these cognitive learning theorists. 
The fourth variable that's examined is the personality variables. The first personality variable is called agreeableness. This is different from extroversion and introversion types of personality variables which relate to how talkative and social individuals are. Consciousness is another personality variable. It is how ethical, dependable, productive, and purposeful you are within a particular environment. The next is neuroticism which is anxiousness, insecurity, guilt-proneness, and self-consciousness.
