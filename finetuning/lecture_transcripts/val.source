In the last sections we have examined a wide variety of aspects related to classical and operant, and instrumental conditioning. In this section we begin talking about the last major and the current model of learning that is pretty much used by a lot of people today. These are called cognitive models. So, let’s begin by looking at some of the theorists of cognition which is shown on slide two. As you can see, a lot of the theorists of cognitive psychology relate all the way back to Plato. They include people like Tollman, Hull, and a variety of other people such as Anderson. In the last sections that we’ve talked about within instrumental and operant conditioning, we talked about some kind of stimulus causing some kind of response. And then following the response by some consequent stimulus. It depended upon the particular approach that one took whether one focused on the initial stimuli or the consequent stimuli following a response. In cognitive models, what is focused on is not the consequent stimulus or the initial stimulus, but what is going on inside the organism. We will talk about and label that stimulus with an O. So, what goes on inside the organism is the most important thing for cognitive theorists. So what kind of internal variables are investigated with different cognitive models of learning. These are listed on slide four. (For example, locus of control, expectancy, etc. ). So, let’s look at some of these variables a little more closelyThe first of these is locus of control and is shown on slide five. In essence locus of control is defined as how much control an individual feels they have over their environment. For Locus of control, the important point is where the control is. For example, if an individual feels they have no control over their environment, (that is they have little connection between the behavior and the rewards), they have what is called a high external locus of control. That is, everything outside of them controls what is going on with their behavior. Well, individuals with high internal locus of control basically believe that the world is responsive to my actions. That is, everything occurs because of what I do. Now a second variable that relates to cognitive control and internal variables is what we call self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is the belief that you have in your own ability. That is, the confidence you have that you will succeed at something. So individuals with high self-efficacy believe that they can succeed at anything, whereas individuals with low self-efficacy believe that they can’t succeed at anything at all. A third variable relates to what we call expectancy, and this is shown in slide seven. Expectancy basically relates to what your expectation about what will happen in a particular situation. For example, if you believe that you will get an A on your exam, you then engage in particular behaviors usually to help you get that A. So it’s your expectation about what will happen is that the most important and is studied by these cognitive learning theorists. The next variable that’s examined are what we call personality variables. There are many variables that are examined and some are listed in slide eight. For example, there’s the big five. So let’s walk through each of those beginning on slide nine. The first one is what we call agreeableness. This is the classic example of a personality variable. For example, is the individual sympathetic, warm, trusting, cooperative, etc. This is a little different from extroversion types of personality variables. Extroversion and introversion basically relate to how talkative, social, fun-loving and affectionate individuals are. If individuals have highly extroverted, they basically walk into a room with anybody and start having a great time, are fun, talkable, and everything else. Or if they are kind of shy and withdrawn, which would be low, this would be introversion. By the way, professors tend to be very introverted for the most part, even though we do do well in certain situations. Conscientiousness is another personality variable that’s examined. That is, how ethical, dependable, productive, and purposeful you are within a particular environment. The next variable is shown in slide 12 and relates to what we call neuroticism. Are you anxious, insecure, guilt-prone, self-conscious and on and on. These are a variety of different variables that relate to different aspects of personality that we study in different models of learning. And finally, how open you are (shown in slide 13). Are you daring, are you non-conforming, do you have lots of interests, are you imaginative, or are you the opposite of each of those. So again, these are a variety of different personality variables that are aspects of internal variables of cognitive psychology. All of these different things are investigated. The next major aspect that we look at when we examine internal events relate to what are called traits. The classic person who’s looked at traits is Allport . Allport defines three different major traits that we have. So lets examine these for a minute. Cardinal traits for Allport (as we see in slide 15) are traits that dominate an individual’s life. That is, your passion to serve others, to acquire wealth, or whatever they are. It’s basically things that dominate your life and makes you behave the way you are. The second type of trait is what we call central traits. These are shown in slide 16. These are descriptive traits that you would use to describe someone. Are they nice, do they dress well, etc. And finally, we have what are called secondary traits. That is, these are traits that are not obvious, that show up in particular situations. For example, aggressiveness with an individual who’s pretty mellow and cool but when they get to a baseball or a basketball game, they turn into a total monster. These are traits that are not normally obvious to an individual, but show up in particular situations. So in general when we look at cognitive psychology and cognitive learning, what we look at are internal events that are out there. And basically these internal events are all examined within cognitive models. Again within a cognitive model, the focus is on things inside the organism. that is, the mind. And as a consequence of that, the models are much harder to measure than some kind of objective behavior that’s usually discussed by Skinner and others. So in general what we see here is that we have a variety of different things that relates to cognitive models of learning. In the next section, we will continue on with this discussion, so until then have yourself a great day. 
In the last class, we discussed the nature of groups: how they are formed, and what characteristics they have in common. Today we will focus on two particular types of groups: what sociologists call “ingroups” and “outgroups. ” Let’s clarify the definitions of each type of group, and then we’ll look at some examples. First of all, what is an ingroup? Most of us are members, on some level, of at least one ingroup. These are people with whom you feel a close attachment or connection, with whom you identify strongly. An example of an ingroup could be a person’s family, or a close group of friends. Members of an ingroup may all dress in a similar style, or listen to similar music, or use a similar way of speaking—they may even have their own specialized words for certain things. However, ingroups typically define themselves not just in relation to the members of that group, but in relation to other groups that are different from the ingroup. These other groups, in contrast to the ingroup, are called outgroups. An outgroup is a group that is viewed from the perspective of an ingroup, often in negative terms. Members of an ingroup may feel a sense of difference or separateness from the outgroup. They may feel excluded. They may even feel a strong sense of opposition or conflict with the outgroup—or even hatred. Outgroups help to define ingroups by providing the ingroup with a sense of identity against or in opposition to them. The ingroup may magnify, or emphasize, certain characteristics that make them distinctly different from the outgroup. In other words, one person’s ingroup is another person’s outgroup. To illustrate, members of a neighborhood gang may wear certain types of clothing to differentiate themselves from rival gangs, or from non-gang members—members of the dominant or mainstream culture. As another example—and an even more extreme one—countries or cultures at war may emphasize their difference from the country they are at war with, in order to increase unity and loyalty in their ingroup. This leads to an “us versus them” mentality, that, in turn, can increase any existing conflict even as it strengthens the ingroup’s sense of identity. Ingroups and outgroups tend to view one another in very separate terms, and they usually have little or no interaction with each other. As a result, these groups don’t have a lot of real information or firsthand experience with one another. And as a consequence of the lack of information, they rely heavily on stereotypes and misinformation about each other. The stereotypes then reinforce the ingroup’s mistrust of or hatred toward the outgroup. Indeed, ingroups and outgroups come into conflict most frequently over symbolic representations of the groups: objects or places that hold a great deal of meaning for one group, and that symbolize, or stand for, the group in some way. An obvious example of this can be seen in how one country may seek to destroy a flag, a statue, or a building that represents a country it is at war with. During the conflict in Iraq, for example, a statue of Saddam Hussein was toppled and dragged through the streets as a symbol of an outgroup. Destroying the objects and symbols associated with one group can be a way of imagining that they are destroying the group itself. It’s important to clarify, however, that the symbol itself isn’t the cause of the conflict—it’s the meaning attached to the symbol, a point at which members of an ingroup can express their identity as distinct from the outgroup, and a point at which the ingroup can act out its emotions toward an opposing group. 
hey everyone and welcome back to cs196 and welcome to part two of bash so let's quickly go over our objectives for today so firstly i want to teach a few more commands in bash the ones listed down here and i want to go over logical operators too i then want to go over text editors in bash the ones listed here i want to go through aliasing and finally as an extra bonus i want to go through an intro to bash scripting so let's get right into it our first command for today is a super useful one it's called sudo and sudo stands for super user do what 0 does is it gives the user root privileges so that's similar to admin rights so the usage is if you type sudo and then some command you'll be prompted to type the root password which will be the password of the admin whoever the super user is and the command we run as a super user so for those of you are unsure who who the root user is think of the root as administrator for your computer or your network or whatever you're working on they essentially have the power to do whatever they want on the machine so that being said with great power comes great responsibility with sudo you can do anything potentially even mess with your computer delete important files delete things that might print your computer money as well as it should so be incredibly careful using sudo and only use it when you know exactly what you're using it for so for example let's say i wanted to create a file using the touch command as super user so what i would do is i'd write sudo and then the command so touch let's call the file file sudo after i run the command i'll be prompted with a password like so and notice the timeline password that nothing is actually showing up in that password bar so let me put my password in and now this command is run as a super user now this isn't a really exciting option because you know you can create a file even if you're not the super user but for more powerful names and things that require a super user you can use sudo to get that extra access like for accessing restricted files or something like that notice now though if i want to delete the file as super user file sudo i won't be prompted for the password again because they know we're in the same session and we're probably still the same user so remember be very very careful using sudo because you can do anything with it and you really don't want to risk messing with your computer and here's a fun tweet that i found it's what i imagined practice like so parent can you please clean your room kid no parent pseudo-clean your room yep fine i know it's not that funny but i thought it was pretty funny so um next we have echo so the echo command essentially allows you to print into bash so this seems kind of useless initially but it's very useful when you're training longer commands to debug while and wrong so your usage for the echo command is oh sorry about that is you write echo sum string and then the sum string that you put after echo will be printed into the terminal window and will be ended with a new line so what's important about that is that it just means that your new your next prompt will be on a new line of the same line as the string you printed and i'll show you that in our example so if we wrote echo hello bash world this will just print this message into the terminal window so let's try and recreate that in our terminal window here so let's echo open speech mark hello bash world closing speech mark enter and just print that there and what i meant by saying it puts a new line character at the end is what what happens here notice how this intro to bash thing doesn't just start on this new line on the same line here there's a new line character here that pushes us down to this line down here for the prompt so this isn't might not seem very useful but it's useful when you're training longer commands so you can debug going wrong with longer bash commands or when you're writing batch scripts think of it as a regular print statement let me hide my camera there so now we're on to find find is a really powerful tool for locating files and once you find a file you can then run commands on those files that you just found so the usage is you right put find and then your path the directory and then hit enter and the path to all the files in that directory will be printed to terminal and this includes files inside directories inside the directory specified so let's try find dot and see what happens so notice here where the intro to bash folder but within to enter the bash folder is a bunch of other directories other folders in them and other files in them so let's do find dot so the dot indicates the current directory and notice all the files that are in here are now being printed and all the files that are within those like directories are also being printed like so so this is a really useful way to find out exactly what's in your directory so let's say i wanted to find out what was in just directory 2. i could do find directory1 directory2 give that path and now we see what's in here so this alone might not seem super useful we can build on this like so so if you use the flag name followed by a file you can find the pads to specific files so let's say you have a really big project and you want to find a specific file this is a really useful way to do that so usage is if you type find the path and then use the name flag followed by the file name when you hit enter the term will print the path to the files with that name so let's first demonstrate that before we go into wild cards so let's say we're looking for this filender. txt what i can do is i can do well say i know this file is here somewhere with an intro to bash what i can do is i can do find dot because that's the path we know it's somewhere within this directory and then do name file enter dot txt so trying to find this file here or the path that file there hit enter we get the full path all the way to where we want to be relative to where we were initially which is the intro to bash folder so this is really good when you're trying to find a specific file or a path display file from a higher level folder or from a very large a folder with a bunch of files in it but what makes it really useful is if you use wild cards so the astros wildcard can let you select a group of files so for example if i do asterisk. txt what that's saying is we don't care what comes the asterisk along as long as the file ends in txt so this will select all the text files and so if also let's say we have something that says 196 star dot txt this will find all text files that start with the string 196. so essentially all files start with string 196 have something in the middle we don't care what's in the wild card and ends in dots txt so firstly let's try and find all the text files that are within intro to bash so we first do find dot to indicate the current directory and now at least i always actually have to put speech marks when using wild cards or trying to find a file a name sorry so you name speech marks asterisk to indicate that we don't care what the file is called just as long as it ends in dot txt so use a pattern matching and we enter we see all the text files that within the directory not just within this level here but in all the lower levels too have been listed out here and that's really useful when you're trying to find a specific file or speak type of file within a huge uh directory so now let's create a bunch of files to start with 196. so touch 196 a dot txt touch 196 a b dot txt oh i spelt it wrong okay so a bunch of files down here that all start with 196. and i want to find only the files to start with 196 we use find dot indicate the current directory name and we put 196 wildcard. txt and what this is telling uh bash is that or the find command sorry is that we want whatever we're looking for to start with 196 we don't care what's in the middle because there's a wild card here and we want to end in dot txt so now when i hit enter we see that all the files oh sorry about that let me make this a little smaller and now we see that all the files that we just created the starter 196 and ended. txt are being listed here and i'm sure i'll tell you why this is really useful in trying to find files within larger directories because using pattern matching to specifically get what you're looking for another point on that is use the i name flag it'll make your search case insensitive so using the name flag is case sensitive ina will make it case insensitive um just demo that quickly we make two files let's call one cs. txt and let's call one cs2. txt if i just try find cs star so to say start to see us doesn't matter what it ends in we only get this file here but if i do i name and i hit enter both those files are listed because we're saying that we don't care if this is insensitive case sensitive or case insensitive and just to go over this pattern matching again we're just saying we want file to start with the cs or in this case c and capital s and whatever comes after that doesn't matter we have a wild card now we have the delete flag so if you use the flag delete all the files that are returned by the find command will be deleted so for example if you type find path the directory and then use the delete flag when you hit enter all the files in that specified directory will be deleted so all the files that are returned by find will be deleted second secondly if you type find path directory and then use the name flag and specify specific name of a file or specific pattern match and then hit delete when you hit enter all the files of that name and specified directory will be deleted so this is a great way for us to get rid of all these files we created with the 196 start so just as a recap let's try and find them first so 196 star dot txt and now we see all those files being listed here if we add delete now when i try find nothing's coming out because we deleted all those files next we have grep crap is a really powerful tool it stands for global regular expression print so graph is used to search for text and return matching lines in a given file so its usage is if you type grep the text you're searching for and then a file to search for and hit enter the terminal will print the lines where the search text was found and file to search so for example we have this file here called names. txt which i'll show you in a minute if we grab rohan it'll print all the lines and name the txt where rohan was found so let's first cat this file names. txt and this is what it says here if i do grep rohan names. txt and hit enter all the lines where rohan appears will be printed out here notice that it's case sensitive rohan here and ron and sammy down here which starts with the lowercase r have not shown up so now we have the w flag with grab using the w flag will turn only exact matches not just a partial match so example if a file has the words rohan and ron and sammy on two separate lines grep will return both the lines but if we use w flag then only rohan the first example will be returned so the way we use this is the usage is grep search text file to search similarly as we did before and then it's w flag so firstly notice here when we did grep normally disappears here this appears but then not rohan also appears because this is a part of that like word similarly this also appears if i use the w flag these two options get removed but this isn't an exact match of the search text that we're looking for notice also that rowan and sammy this full sentence is returned and that's because there's an exact match of the word we're looking for within this entire sentence next we have the i flag so using the i flag will make the search case insensitive so for example if if a file is the words rohan and lowercase rohan on two separate lines graph will return only the first line because it's case sensitive but if you use i flag it will return both the lines so the way we do this is we just put an eye flag at the end of our grab or at the start if you want you can also put the flag over here hit enter and notice all instances where roland is put not just where it's a capital r had been returned another cool thing with graph is that you can stack flags on top of each other so for example if you grab wi and then you put whatever you're searching for and look for a case insensitive search and also an exact search so what does that look like well first let's look at what a regular graph function grab for rohan and names. txt looks like right and let's just cat names. txt as well so you know what's in here if we want only a case insensitive but with an exact match we'll only get these three lines because these are the only lines which are case intensive and match rohan and also where there's an exact match no concatenated words like this or like this or like this crap is very useful in searching large text files and large documents to find exactly what you're looking for now we have diff diff is short for difference and diff will compare two files line by line and identify the lines where they differ so for example if you type diff file one file two and then press enter you will see the difference between file one and file two printed in the terminal so for example i do diff a. txt and b. txd as the two arguments it'll print the differences between the two files in uh in the terminal window files are identical then nothing will be printed so let's try and demo this let's create a file let's call it a. txt another file called b. txt if i cat these files and i cat this one notice that there's nothing in them they're pretty much identical not pretty much they are exactly identical there's nothing in them if i try and diff them nothing is printed because they have no differences but let's say i put something a. txt so we're using a ventex editor which we'll cover shortly this is a if i diff this now notice it tells me where the difference occurred and it'll tell me what the difference was if i put something into b and diff it we see that the differences are both being listed here so this is useful when you're trying to for example look at two outputs and see whether the same or they're different try to analyze them because this is a great job of finding exactly where the differences are and printing them into terminal window for you to use okay now moving on to logical operators so this is ampersand ampersand or the and logical operator so what it does it lets you do several commands sequentially all in one line as long as all the preceding commands complete successfully so what does that mean so let's look at the usage first if you type command one and then command two and then command three and then and command four and hit enter then all the four commands enter will be done one after the other so we won this one first then this one then this one then this one but let's say this one runs this one runs but then command 3 fails command 4 will not be run all proceeding commands have to be completed successfully for the command to be run so for example over here if i do make directory 3 and cd directory 3 touch new file and then cd dot dot what this does is it'll create a new directory move into it create a new file within that directory and then cd out of there so let's actually just demo that so we're entered a bash right now we're over here if i do mk dir um 303 and cd der not die dirt3 and touch testing dot txt and cd dot dot notice it looks like nothing happened you did see a little motion here i'm sure but if i print the working directory in the same spot as i was before but if i list notice that there's a new directory 3 and if i list the contents of directory 3 testing. txt exists there but now watch let's try let's say i try to cd into some random file just the file doesn't this folder doesn't exist and then i try to echo this message so we know this directory doesn't exist as you can see here we also use find if we wanted to to double check that when i hit enter notice that this message wasn't printed well that's because as shown this error message this didn't complete successfully this first command didn't complete successfully so we didn't go on to the next one over here and now we have the or logical operator so it looks like these two vertical bars so first the way this works is it'll try the first command the one preceding the auralogical operator and if the first command fails it'll do the command after the logical operator so in the usage here you see if you type command 1 or command 2 and then press enter bash will first try to run command 1. a command will complete successfully then this whole thing ends after command 1 runs but if for any reason command 1 fails it'll run command 2 instead so this is a good way to uh to double check if something that you ran work successfully you could say like run a python script here and there's any error like just run this instead so for example if you try to cd to this not a real directory this is a fake directory or echo that doesn't exist if this first directory doesn't exist it will lead to the second command running and let us know that nothing was that this one failed so let's actually try that here so let's see the uh fake dir and we know looking over here that doesn't exist or echo that directory doesn't exist oh it's missed uh let's put the closing part there that's weird anyways so what happened here was it said nope this directory didn't exist and then it echoed that this message here another cool thing you can do is you can chain logical operators so you can chain long operations in one line using different logical operators and that's really useful if you want to try to do multiple things at once with like these checks like with the or statements for example so what would this command do take a look at this line here and you can pause the video here and try and guess what this would do i'm going to copy this so we can run this in our terminal window okay now that you guys had a second look at it let's run this and then walk through what happened okay so firstly i tried to cd into this fake directory well we know zero feet directory so it told us that because it told us that here there's an error there's an add operator and it was going to echo and move to fake directory but because the proceeding statement failed this was not run and because this whole statement failed this was run instead and it said there was no directory there pretty straightforward this is useful for running long commands and having a little check to see if anything proceeding it failed so now we're going to move away from commands and try to move to text editors in bash so firstly how do we edit a regular file well if you want to add a normal file we just use a text editor like vs code or notepad but how do we edit files within bash well again we use the text editor so these will be different from ones you may be familiar with because you can't actually click on anything within bash text editors so despite this initial learning curve they can actually be very powerful and efficient and sometimes you were forced to use them for example let's say you're working on a vm right out of your terminal like you have to ssh into a vm or for server-side scripting you try to ssh to your server you might be forced to use a text editor within bash so the most popular text editors in bash are vim and emacs we'll also go over nano which the not as popular as these two but it's definitely the easiest one to start learning and the one i've started learning with first so let's start off with them them is a popular term letter that was released in 1991 so you start by typing vim followed by a file name if the file exists then vim will open the file but if it doesn't exist then if you save after closing them it'll create that file so let's follow along with this let's do them them file. txt so when you open up them initially it opens up in command mode and this can be identified by lack of description at the bottom of the window like so just as the file name so in command mode you can use these keys to quickly navigate and do a few powerful things so firstly before we do this let me put some data into our text file this is a them file text file with some random words and other bits of info okay i'm happy with that now let's look at some of the command mode uh shortcuts so firstly we can use hjkl to go left down up right so j and k i used to move down and up respectively l used to move right and has to be used to move left you might think that's a pretty weird set of like keys to use but if you look down and keep your hand there you notice it's actually right in the hot bar and by doing this you can navigate quickly through your text file without having to move your hand around to the arrow keys or your mouse next we have the dollar sign and then the underscore a dollar sign will move your cursor to the end of the line and underscore will move your cursor to the beginning of the line so if you do dollar you'll go over there underscore will take you there w and b are pretty cool they move your cursor forward and backward one word at a time and we can use this forward slash some word to move the cursor to the next occurrence of that word so first let's do wb w takes us forward like any video game you play on your keyboard and b takes you backward one word if you reach the end of the file it'll take it'll stop you there and if you do forward slash and you write some word for example let's write bits it'll take you the next occurrence of that word like so notice how it came appeared down here you can also move around the file if you use line number followed by gg it'll move the cursor to the start of the line beginning of with the line number you specified so if i did one gg it'll take me to the first file if i did four gigi take me to that fourth line there again a quick way to navigate through your file now you have dd d deletes the line that the cursor is on and u is undo so let's demonstrate that together let's go up here to dd we deleted that line entirely and u brings it back so command mode is really a great way to quickly navigate through your file and have a quick interaction with the file itself but how do we actually put stuff into our file well if you press i you can enter insert mode and insert mode the key uh you can use the keys normally so you insert data that you want to the file and if you press the escape key you'll go back to command mode so if i press i i can now enter data entering data into file and i can use the arrow keys to move around the file notice if i try to use like the hotkeys like hjkl it won't navigate the file i'll just type into there and if i type escape i go back into command mode and i can do all the things that i that we went through in the last page finally very importantly how do we exit them and this is actually kind of a cs meme because people get stuck in them and there's no clear way of leaving it to exit them uh you need to firstly return back to command mode and either press colonqueue to quit and this only this only works that many changes the file like if you just use vim to read the file colon q exclamation mark to quit without saving and colon wq to write and quit so let's firstly try and just colon queue out of this we'll say no because you've made changes here but if i do colon wq i'll be saving quitting and now we have a new vim file here and just uh make it clear vim a vim file isn't like different from regular files this is just a regular old text file i just called it vim file so we know what we're working with so i do vim vim file here and i delete everything if i exit and i use queue exclamation mark when i cap this file notice that none of those changes were saved emacs is another popular term letter that was released in 1985. so to start emacs you type emacs followed by the file name very similar to them also similarly given if the file exists that emacs will open the file but if the file doesn't exist then if you save after closing emacs it will create that file the x is similar to them however does not use modes like them instead commands are prefixed by the control keys or the meta alt option key so all for windows and option for mac when you open emacs there are no modes so you can start typing straight away so let's demonstrate that emacs emacs. txt so notice it's straightway we can start typing this is an emacs created file blah blah cs196 it's cool and i'm also just going to scroll down here to show you how windows work and then move up so if you hold ctrl and then type a or e you'll go to the beginning or end of the file respectively if you type control v you'll move down one page so a page is the amount of text visible on the window so notice here we can only see this much even though we know this text below control under scroll undo changes and control h will bring up a help page so if we do control e sorry a it'll take the start of the sentence and e will take us the end like that control v will take us down one window uh let's maybe actually delete this line here control underscore will bring back that line it's just undues finally something cool if you do control h you get this cool um tutorial on how to use emacs next if you hold the meta key or the option or alt key depending on what device you're using and then use f or b you'll move further back with respect to your one word and use a or you'll move to the start end of sentence respectively so for this i'm actually going to move to terminal because an item if you press the options key on a mac at least it has a few peculiarities but on very little terminal that doesn't exist so emacs random dot i can't spell random. txt um this is a random text file blah blah so if i do control b sorry meta b i move back one word at a time so that's option b on a mac and all b out of windows and if i do option f i can move forward like so again a or e will take me back to the start end of a sentence let me put a full stop here to demonstrate that take me back to here back there let me put a full stop here too okay like that so if you press escape followed by um a greater than sign yeah great and signing with the end of the file if you escape followed by less than sign you'll move to the start of the file so let's do escape greater than go to the end of the file escape less than oop escape less than take to the start of the file like so to save a file on e9x you'll control then press x then s and to exit you hold ctrl then press x then c so let's demonstrate that if i do control x then s that saves it so you can see that there because this file is out of my desktop i do control x and c we leave emacs you close that and again if i list you can see now that there's an emax file if i can it all the information we put in there is now there also fun a little bit of information about emacs and you can play a bunch of games inside it i'm not going to understand the lecture but you can look it up you play tetris this is gamoku a bunch of fun stuff finally we have nano so nano is not as popular as them or emacs but it was very it's very very easy to use so nano was released in 2000 and has the smallest learning curve out of all the editors we've looked at today so to start you just type nano followed by the file name and again if it exists that will open the file and if it doesn't exist then it'll create it if you save after closing nano so now you can go ahead and start typing as soon as you open up nano and the commands that you need are at the bottom of the editor so i can just do nano nano file dot txt dot txt and i can just start typing this is a nano file random text everything i need is down here at the bottom so to exit i can just do control x y to say yes and i hit enter and i can leave and see if i can't that file we made it has everything we just wrote in there it's definitely the easiest one to use and it's the first one i picked up i personally use vim but you should try all three and see which one you're comfortable with now we're going to talk about aliasing so aliasing is a powerful tool to create best shortcuts so we do this by using the alias keyword so for example you for the usage sorry as you do alias followed by the shortcut name equals and then sum command so this will create alias so if we type shortcut name this full command here which is usually longer will be run and to remove alias we simply use the unalias keyword like that so let's say for example every time we do ls we don't want it to just ls the files we want to ls all the files so we can see the hidden ones as well that's pretty easy we can just do alias ls equals ls a so using the all flag so now when i write ls notice that all the files are being listed not just the regular ones but even the hidden ones too but let's say we've got board of this i'm going to go back we'll just do unalias ls pretty cool another cool thing you can do is let's say when you open up bash we know that we don't start off right in the desktop we start off in a higher up folder so let's say we want to go there directly every time we open up our terminal so let's alias so let's first see what the command is cd desktop enter the batch let's see we want to get here every time quickly every time we open up bash we can copy that and we do alias let's say 190 cs196 as our alias put the command in there hit enter now i hit cs196 it'll take me a right to intro to bash pretty cool i can aliase it write cs196 and now when i write cs196 it'll tell me this command doesn't exist because we removed that alias so now we've covered all the content that i think is relevant and useful for most of the work you'll be doing with bash and in your project especially but as extra bit of information we're going to cover an introduction to bash scripting so within bash you also write scripts to run commands and these can even take an input so bash scripts have the dot sh extension and you can run the scripts by typing bash followed by the script name dot sh so let's first talk about variables within batch scripts so you can declare a variable by choosing a variable name and then assigning a value to it you do not need to declare the type of a variable as you have to do in java for example it's like python where you don't need to clear a type to use the variable later you put a dollar sign in front of it to indicate that it is a variable and note don't put spaces around your variables so i have a bunch of scripts over here that we can use so let's open these up in vs code because that's easy to read let's first look at this bit of code here so we have this secret variable and it has some password there and we're going to echo it and to echo it so echo as we know is a batch command we use echo followed by the variable name we use the dollar sign to indicate that it's a variable so we have that over here it's called var. s. h let's run this so as expected it first prints the password on this line next it prints the secret message says whatever the password is and then says it again these are two ways of identifying a variable within the echo now let's talk about conditionals in bash scripting so you can also use conditionals in batch scripting just like you could in a regular programming language for those of you don't know what a conditional is essentially it's if else or if elif else statements llf is just short for elsif essentially what this lets you do is make decisions on what should be run in the code based on the condition of certain variables so note let me get the red pointer for this you need spaces between the condition and the bracket here so your condition your fl statements are in this form and the end and if backwards there so you can use dash eq as an equals operator for numerical comparison so you could say like five dash you know eq five and that will return true or five e cubed six would return false you can use dash n e as a not equals operator for numerical comparisons you can use e e not ee sorry equals equals as an equals operator for string comparisons and you can use estimation mark equals or not equals uh as not equals operator for string comparisons so take a look at this code snippet here you pause and take a look at it we're also going to look at it over here fold bigger so firstly we're declaring this variable num saying it's 20. stir is hello first we'll echo this so we'll say hello we go to the first loop here if num does not equal 20 then we print what it is otherwise if string equals hello then we echo hi there else we print while i'm confused so what do you think this should do there was an answer down there but what do you think this should do well it should say hello and then hi there because string does equal hello let's write it like this i believe yeah don't need the speech marks around it and um say hi there because hello does match hello and i'll respond with that so now i'm gonna cover that up take a look at this code snippet here let me comment this out what do you think this code snippet should do pause there read through it okay i'm gonna run it now said hello well i'm confused why did it say that well the first condition is false because 20 obviously does equal 20. secondly this condition here is false because hello does not equal word so we have the else statement which is well i'm confused like so now let's talk about loops loops are really powerful tool to let you do the same lines of code repeatedly lets you do a lot of things within with a few lines of code so the form of a loop is like this so you do four some counter in some range here this is the range so it's your starting number to your ending number and then you do whatever is here do something take a look at that now let's look at an actual example so for i in range 1 to 10 do echo we are on loop i so what do we do here well we're taking this variable here or echoing it in the string so take a guess what it does i'm sure it's pretty obvious it just prints that we are on loop blank from one to ten now we have functions so for those who don't know what function is essentially it allows you to take a chunk of code and give it and be able to call that chunk of code with a unique name so function declaration is in this form we give a function name two brackets and then we put all the stuff that the function is meant to do within those two brackets here if you pass a value into the function the function will save this into dollar sign one i'll talk about that in just a second and the way you call a function is you put the function name and then the values that you're passing into it so let's look at this function here so we have this greet person function here so what it's doing is it's echoing so printing hi there some variable you look second variable so let me talk about these variables you're probably wondering why are we starting at one or not zero i thought this was a programming language well the first variable is actually greek person this is dollar sign zero that would be the function call itself the next variable would be dollar second one dollar sign two dollar time three etc etc etc and you can use those variables within your function here so if i comment this line out and i try and run this nothing happens that's because a function doesn't run on its own you have to call the function like on this line here line five for it to do anything so now if i call the function it'll say hi there rohan you look great but let's say you know i got out of bed late this morning we can change the variables we pass this function and say either one you look okay and again if you add if you wanted to add a third variable we could just simply add add it like so let's put is cold today like that and with that we're at the end of the lecture i hope you found the content we taught today interesting and i hope you learned something bash scripting is tricky so if you found that confusing don't worry about it this is not something we'll be testing you on but it's a cool extra credit opportunity and we will be offering you guys extra credit uh if you can do some bash scripting later on this week so if you have any questions make sure you drop the discord r on twitch and i'll see you the next one
welcome to another dose productions video today we're taking a look at the southern colonies roughly from 1588 to 1733 and as always no matter which apush book you are using this video is going to help you with all the important content so it's important to keep in mind that England is a little bit slow to the colonization game it wasn't until after England defeats the Spanish Armada in 1588 that England is really in a position of being powerful enough to challenge the other countries especially Spain and to begin the process of planting colonies English colonization is going to be different for a variety of reasons but one important one to keep in mind is that England was a Protestant country we learned about in world history the Protestant Reformation and England was a Protestant country whereas Spain was largely Catholic it's important to note the different types of colonies how they're going to be paid for and how they are run for example you have joint stock companies where stockholders invest in a company such as the Virginia Company of London and they share in the potential profits or losses from the colony this can also be referred to as a corporate colony another type of colony you're going to see as a proprietorship where a land is given by the king to an individual or to a group of individuals and then finally a royal colony it's paid for and ruled directly by the monarchy England's first attempt at colonization is not going to go well the Colony of Roanoke under Sir Walter Raleigh in 1587 and what is today North Carolina in fact Walter Raleigh goes back to Europe and when some individuals return in 1590 the colony is found to be deserted all of the men and women are gone England's first success in colonization of North America's is going to take place in the Chesapeake and make sure you know this geographic region the Chesapeake colonies are going to refer to Virginia and Maryland it's really in the upper south you can see right there in the Chesapeake Bay and the first permanent English colony in North America will be established at Jamestown in 1607 its motive was wealth the king King James the first gives a charter to the colonists and in 1607 they establish Jamestown it's set up under a joint-stock company the Virginia Company of London remember they're going to share in the profits as well as the losses one hundred male settlers arrived at Jamestown and they suffer a starving period these are men who are wealthy lured looking for gold like the Spanish had achieved they're not wanting to do all the hard labor many of the original settlers died of disease and starvation because the land was hot humid mosquito infested and the settlers were not prepared for this hard work luckily John Smith comes in and establishes military discipline and saves the colony he implements ax you don't work you don't eat policy and the colony starts to stabilize John Rolfe is going to give the colony something to make money on when he introduces the cultivation of tobacco in colonial Virginia so what's life like in colonial Virginia tobacco provided the colony with a cash crop and led to the rise of the plantation system you have the rise of very large farms you can see tobacco right there in the image and with the cultivation of tobacco you need a cheap labor supply and early on in colonial Virginia James towns history it's going to be indentured servants they are going to serve as the early labor force of Virginia indentured servants basically serve for a period of time usually around four to seven years in exchange for passage to the colony they would work and at the end of their service in theory they would be granted their freedom and perhaps some land to encourage this the headright system was introduced where individuals would get land if you paid for somebody's journey to the colony and what this ends up doing is the rich end up getting richer the wealthy people are paying for indentured servants to come over and getting more and more and and the sad part is many indentured servants weren't out living the terms of their contract they would die as the colony develops they establish some government structures the House of Burgesses established in 1619 this is a form of early representative government in fact it's the first in what will be the future United States this elected representative government didn't happen in French or Spanish colonies so this is unique to the British colonies it starts a tradition of self-rule but the House of Burgess was largely made up of the wealthy planters problems are going to begin to develop in the colony tobacco destroyed the land it always kind of required more and more land to cultivate this crop and as the demand for land goes up so does the demand for labour and as this demand for land goes up people keep moving further and further into the interior into the frontier as you can see on the map along with the river at the James River tensions increase with the natives as colonists move west into Native American land and that's going to lead to two important developments one the relationship with Native Americans in the region and the development of slavery so first things first what was going on with the native people there was a very hostile relationship that developed between the colonists and the Powhatan tribe Powhatan was the chief in the area and all the different tribes of the Chesapeake region kind of were lumped together under Chief Powhatan as we already mentioned tensions increased as the settlers moved west you could see on the map that English settlements are very close to existing Native American settlements amongst the powhatan confederacy a series of wars are going to break out between the year 1610 to 1646 these are collectively known as the Anglo patan Wars the first one ends in 1614 with the marriage between Pocahontas and John Rolfe they look nothing like that at all peace is temporary with this first known interracial Union in Virginia this was very rare for the English and the natives to intermarry and another war will begin with the massacre of 1622 Powhatan's confederacy attacks in 1622 tired of the continual taking of their land and the decimation of their population by european diseases and with the massacre of 1622 over 300 colonists are killed which is about one third of the population the war goes on for a while and by 1624 the Jemez town becomes a royal colony the Virginia Company of London was bankrupt the crown takes over colonial Virginia and by 1646 that pal Houghton Confederacy is largely defeated and there's a variety of reasons why they are defeated and it's largely due to disease which had destroyed the population disorganization keep in mind these tribes were different and so it was hard to put up a united front and they were disposable in the minds of the English they had no need for them so they're going to wipe them out it's important to note labor relations in colonial Virginia and the transition to slavery we've already seen in the early period the primary labor source was indentured servants but the problem was eventually these individuals were out living their contract and making demands on the colony the first Africans were brought into the colony in 1619 aboard a Dutch ship but in this early period indentured servants were the majority of the workers so how does this change take place well very important event to keep in mind is Bacon's Rebellion it takes place in 1676 mmmm bacon and it has nothing to do with the tasty food here is the background to it there was growing frustration with a lack of land in fact many of these indentured servants were beginning to outlive the end of their contract and they wanted land and governor Berkeley the governor of the colony did not allow land hungry settlers to move too far west you can see on the map why part of the reason is he wants to avoid clashes with Native Americans on the frontier there also was frustration with the lack of political power remember the House of Burgess was dominated by the plantation elite so many of these former indentured servants had no political or economic opportunities in the colony and finally they wanted the government in Jamestown the indentured servants and the free White's wanted the government in Jamestown to do something about Native American attacks on the frontier governor Berkeley was reluctant to do so because he was benefiting from a lucrative fur trade with Native Americans on the frontier and all of these tensions erupt into something called Bacon's Rebellion the leader of the rebellion is Nathaniel bacon he leads a group of rebellion against the Indians on the frontier where they start randomly indiscriminately killing Native Americans who had allegedly attacked the colonists and they also moved their frustrations to Jamestown where they burned down the capital this is a big crisis in the colony Nathaniel bacon I'd like to thank Ward this bacon covered suit but unfortunately for the rebels bacon suddenly dies of dysentery the rebellion collapses some of the rebels are hung and peace comes to the colony the impact of Bacon's Rebellion would be huge it would lead to a transition to African chattel slave labor in other words slavery based upon race where individuals would be considered property and the idea was you could not enslave the native people for a variety of reasons indentured servants were out living their contracts and demanding things they then switched to African slave labor Bacon's Rebellion also reveals tensions in colonial society between the wealthy and the poor as well as regions those poor farmers out in the frontier in the back country versus the more wealthy Tidewater elite in the east another important colony in the Chesapeake that you should know about is Maryland it is north of Virginia you can see there right along the Chesapeake Bay Maryland is a proprietorship unlike Virginia which was a joint stock company the king gives land to Lord Baltimore otherwise known as George Calvert it's the first proprietor colony and much like Virginia tobacco plantations are going to be the thing in Maryland but unlike Virginia there was something unique because not only are they there to make money but they're also there for religious reasons an act of toleration is passed in 1649 this guarantees religious freedom for all Christians and it's intended specifically to protect Catholics Catholics were seeking a refuge from the hostility of England and Marylyn is going to be intended partially for that purpose it is important to note that this is one of the first laws granting religious freedom to all Christians in the English colonies but there are limits to it because it promised death to anyone who denied the divinity of Jesus so religious freedom did not extend to Jews Muslims and other religious groups who were not Christian finally the other colonies in the south south of the chesapeake region we have North Carolina South Carolina and good old Georgia South Carolina is going to be characterized by a cash crop economy really rice plantations are going to be hugely important here you're going to get the development of a very wealthy aristocratic elite huge plantations and very important African slave labour South Carolina is going to be characterized by very long growing seasons and so plantation economy is going to be very profitable in this region North Carolina is going to be very different than South Carolina it's going to be mainly small tobacco farmers very similar to Virginia but much more small farming centered and there's going to be less of a reliance on slavery than in South Carolina it's important you know that the British also had colonies in the Caribbean Barbados and Jamaica are two great examples and in the Caribbean they're going to have a very close relationship with South Carolina they both have these long growing seasons and they're both going to rely on cash crops and slave labor in the case of the Caribbean you're going to see sugarcane production being the major economic enterprise and they're going to have a very strict slave labor system to ensure this remains profitable and finally the last colony to be established will be Georgia in 1733 its intended to serve as a buffer colony against Spanish threats in Florida as well as French threats over there in Louisiana its original purpose was to serve as a penal colony for debtors to kind of bring them over to the new world to start over and originally it bans slavery and the sale of rum James Oglethorpe is one of its key figures early on in its period he successfully defends the colony against the Spanish but the problem is nobody really comes because of all these restrictions and the Spanish and French threat so eventually they drop these restrictions and in 1752 it becomes a royal colony fully controlled by the British and it will become a plantation based slave economy much like South Carolina that's going to do it for the southern colonies if the video

Welcome to an adventure of the mind it begins by looking ahead to the sights and sounds of the mechanical universe there are certain human activities that the mind associates with a particular place because it's somehow more special more elegant there for example I'm not inclined to gamble but if I wanted to I wouldn't go and play poker in some sleazy backroom I would take the Concorde to Monte Carlo put on my tuxedo and play roulette in the casino in the same way when I think of tennis I think of Wimbledon for horse-racing it's the Kentucky Derby for opera is La Scala and for physics if you want the study physics the place is Caltech that's what we're here for let's get started there is a branch of science cosmology it's called that concerns itself with the past present and future of the universe as a whole how did that universe begin how has it evolved and where is it going there is another branch of science in the realm of physics to be exact which is called mechanics the science of mechanics concerns itself with something not quite as philosophical perhaps but no less profound however it started and wherever it's going how does it all work [Music] from the smallest particle to the largest cluster of galaxies what keeps it all going whether it's speeding up slowing down changing direction or cruising straight ahead why does it all behave the way it does whether it's a solid a liquid or a gas or an enigmatic unseen force just how does it all interact and why all of these questions from the simplest to the most profound are by no means late arrivals in one form or another they've been around as long as there have been people to ask them even the earliest human inhabitants of this planet must have looked up at the sky and across the landscape and asked how does it all work and without even knowing it they had taken the first tentative steps to discovering and understanding the mechanical universe if there is a key to understanding the mechanical universe it can be found in the realm of mathematics and among early civilizations there were no greater mathematicians and the ancient Greeks the work of Greek mathematicians added immeasurably to the advancement of science in the area of circles for example they work to the point of exhaustion which is precisely what it took to find the number pi but despite or maybe because of such brilliant discoveries the Greeks fell behind once the Golden Age was over they placed a lower value on the questions than on the answers so with too few questions the world bought Aristotle's mechanics with Plato's ideas and eventually Ptolemy solar system in which the planets orbit the earth uniformly circles on perfect circles was held aloft by conventional wisdom answers instead of questions that went almost unchallenged well into the Renaissance the intellectual direction of Western civilization had fallen into line behind the endless circular argument of the photonic ideal the question isn't really why unless its why tamper with perfection the question is how how 1,500 years after Ptolemy was the perfect circle broken and in what must seem another contradiction of logic how did an orderly new world take shape in the crucible of scientific revolution it began when an extremely curious Polish monk Nicholas Copernicus looked toward the Stars and saw things in a different light among other things in the Copernican solar system the Earth orbits the Sun rather than the other way around why did Copernicus see the universe this way and from a scientific point of view how did such a vision make him the world's first revolutionary an intellectual bridge that had spanned thousands of years wave precariously in the winds of change pillars of an age-old academic community were beset with threatening questions no one was better equipped to fill the intellectual void and galileo galilei though Aristotelian thinking still ruled the world of the Italian Renaissance Galileo was an exception to the rule he was a Copernican with the courage of his convictions in other words he had the right idea at the wrong time fine said his critics an army which arose in defense of the status quo but if the earth really spins why does a ball drop from a tower in Pisa for example land directly below why not in the next city-state for a change the answers were more dangerous than the questions the church which considered him both the threat to Rome and an affront to common sense warned him to leave things in their proper places nonetheless in practice and theory Galileo spoke the truth and proved what seemed to be the impossible and when all was said and done [Music] [Applause] hopefully they'll hit the ground Galileo's findings are not only correct they come down through history as an amazing example of the scientific imagination at work with his brilliant mind set on explaining the universe in scientific terms Galileo's experiments led him to discover the law of inertia with uncanny physical insight and he accurately envisioned the parabolic paths of projectiles as well as the law of falling bodies even today when they come right down to it the questions behind these experiments are as challenging as they were three centuries ago how did Galileo calculate a projectiles path and by doing so how did he begin to propel mathematics deeply into the future in the days when seeing truly was believing how did he disprove the obvious perception about falling objects how can a hammer and a feather land at the same moment and as Galileo himself fell from grace in 1633 why was the whole business of the universe a trial to everyone concerned about the same time every day was something of a trial to the wandering mathematician Johannes Kepler to a man in almost constant flight for his life a life of illness and poverty the loss of loved and loved ones witch-hunts and the even meaner spirits of his associates simple existence was something of a challenge surely no man ever sacrificed more to grasp the scientific truth but on the other hand no man's discoveries ever proved more rewarding and Kepler's laws the law of ellipses the law of equal areas and Kepler's third law of planetary motion the law of harmony with his laws of planetary motion as the key Kepler entered the secret chamber of the cosmos [Music] and yet by explaining how rather than why the solar system works he was destined to remain on the threshold of the mechanical universe it was time for someone else to come along and take the final step on this very path which led directly to the moon along came Isaac Newton with some crucial questions of his own why does an apple fall since an apple Falls why not the moon if an apple and the moon fall for the same reason why doesn't the moon like the Apple crash into the earth with such questions the questions of the life time Newton rather calmly sat down and piece by piece destroyed beyond repair the age-old machinery of the Aristotelian universe and then with answers that were equally astounding he created something to take its place the mechanical universe the mechanical universe a predictable orderly universe obeying precise mathematical laws and with the laws of motion the ability to take on almost any physical challenge with his laws of motion not unlike David confronting Goliath Isaac Newton took on the great issues of mechanics armed with his keen mastery of forces a precise knowledge of trajectories and the universal law of gravitation Newton mastered more than any human being before him and for that he deserves serious attention and considerable fanfare nonetheless in science answers are part of the past the future belongs to the questions that science raises which means that even Newton's laws were only a beginning in the right direction for example in modern times a projecto can be guided with mathematical precision how is that done part of the answer is an instrument called the gyroscope how does it work and in the all-encompassing mechanical universe why is even a bicycle wheel a kind of gyroscope angular momentum is a key to the answer but what is angular momentum and why does it turn out to be so vital throughout the universe from the cutting edge of the most distant galaxies to whirlpools in the family baths angular momentum moves and all the best circles and among other things moving in circles is the key to keeping perfect time few things governed as steadily as today's mechanistic concern with time however while people now have more time on their hands the preoccupation with it is hardly a recent phenomenon what is comparatively recent however is the phenomenon of accurate time it came about gradually day in and day out for 4000 years it finally arrived with an understanding of harmonic motion what is harmonic motion and when it comes right down and up to it how does harmonic motion really work and going full circle in the mechanical universe how is it related to circular motion the answer isn't as mysterious as it may seem at first perception and there's no reason to approach it in a roundabout fashion however sometimes it helps [Music] all it takes is a little differential calculus while Isaac Newton's calculus goes far and wide throughout the mechanical universe the scope of his generosity was considerably more narrow Baron Wilhelm Gottfried von lightness strode the European landscape with the supreme confidence and a number of good reasons for it as a German diplomat and mathematician liveness was so successful that Voltaire characterized him as the epitome of optimism worldly outgoing quite a fellow with the ladies Leibniz had nothing in common with Newton except the discovery of the calculus there was plenty of room on Newton's plate for a little kindness after all he had created the laws of motion the law of universal gravitation the reflector telescope a theoretical explanation for light and Colour the menu of his unmatched accomplishments was extensive to say the least and yet despite so much intelligence Newton permitted if not encouraged a bitter controversy with Leibniz this episode only one of the emotional dramas in the mechanical universe threatened the reputation of one man and the sanity of another but it will also illustrate one of the curious paradoxes that lurk within the human heart of science for example while the scientist isn't always rational the scientific environment nearly always is in fact a physics laboratory is where nature reveals herself in the most rational terms compared to Newton what does the modern scientist really do beyond the well-intentioned textbook definition what's the method of science and in the real world how does the scientific method really work sometimes it begins with a small beaker of oil a sturdy iron pot a dash of Discipline a measure of creativity and perhaps a touch of genius and sometimes although very rarely the result is as significant as the value of the charge of the electron who was this physicist and by what painstaking means did he become one of the more famous men in scientific history past present and future physicists are forever fascinated by the mysteries of nature for example the mysterious nature of light light the very idea has been as hard to grasp as the almost incomprehensible vastness of the universe and its speed has been even harder why does it have a specific value why is it called a fundamental constant and precisely what is a fundamental constant of nature henry cavendish knew the answer when he measured Newton's universal gravitational constant in the process of finding it Cavendish not only weighed the expanding British Empire he weighed the entire planet how in the world did he do that but not by hanging out in a pool these men live by laws that if not exactly legal are nonetheless well within the laws of classical mechanics of course not every man here fully appreciates that fact most walk down Chalky's narrow stairs to shoot a stick or to profit from the experience by some other means but odds are when certain laws of physics are applied just right every man here fully appreciates the effects [Music] the effects depend on the law of conservation of momentum and like the game of billiards it happened to originate in France in the early 17th century Rene Descartes grew up to love mathematics as the workings of God and as a philosopher he sought an explanation for all worldly phenomena in the process Descartes not only conceived the conservation of momentum he discovered analytic geometry with that discovery he changed forever the terrain of mathematics how by one vehicle or another do great scientific explorers approach unknown terrain and when something has been discovered already how can someone else sail right in and claim the credit whatever the science from electricity to mechanics credit sometimes goes not to the first to make a great discovery but to the last surely this was true in the case of James Prescott Joule who was far from the first to explore the realm of energy conservation he might have been the eighth or ninth scientists to come across the law of conservation of energy but like Columbus Joule got the credit for discovery why and in the greater scheme of things why does it really matter in the storehouse of the cosmos the shelves are as amply stocked with energy today as they were the morning the universe opened for business on the other hand if energy is never lost why do muscles get tired and why do masses fall mechanical energy like exercise in general has a lot to do with speed and position for a different perspective on changing positions catch the drift of the good ship Irish Coffee a challenge if there ever was one in the mechanical universe sophisticated electronics state-of-the-art tracking devices personnel beyond compare these are the resources of the United States Coast Guard also behind the scenes there are the tools of vector analysis in a crisis or a classroom how can vector mathematics go to the rescue [Music] in the serious world of science vector mathematics can accomplish miracles so the question is not whether it can come to this rescue but whether it really sure put another way is this music or is it Memorex in any case a classic Memorex commercial this clearly illustrates both excellent reproduction and the physical phenomenon of resonance listening to elephants what is resonances our it's many forms heard from throughout the mechanical universe and why does a mere human voice even one as powerful as Ella Fitzgerald's produce such shattering results and in the even greater atmosphere of the mechanical universe what are some other forms of sound and fury this trio undertook a journey that surpassed every earthly Explorer since the first primitive step into the unknown their destiny had be. 
Welcome to this Hillsdale College online course called Constitution 101 my Constitution we of course mean the greatest and longest living of all the constitutions in history the Constitution the United States we study that here because we're mindful of the fact and always have been at Hillsdale that we are citizens and we need our freedom in order to live well and do our work especially the work of a college which radically depends upon freedom of every kind we teach the Constitution to every student here at the college and now we're going to help you learn something about it the other people who are teaching in this are members of our politics faculty I'm a member of that faculty myself and among them all they may have the most knowledge of the meaning of the Constitution and the significance of the changes that have gone on around it and so it should be a privilege for you to watch this and I hope you enjoy it and I hope you read and continue learning about this for as long as you live and teach others to so much I'll explain depends on that there are a lot of details in this course details of how exactly things work and why they work the tales of different understandings than the one that prevails here about those things and so that will involve us in some complications and it'll be helpful I think that we can keep the kind of general points in mind and I'm going to name some of those today in my lecture my first question I'll ask myself and you is what kind of thing are the Declaration of Independence in the Constitution turns out the answer to that is very enriching they're different documents there's an argument that they're opposed there's a powerful argument in the historical scholarship that the Declaration was meant to be a radical document and the Constitution was meant to be conservative and that those people argue that the Declaration is about the rights of us all and the Constitution is really about protecting the privileged well we we think that's nonsense around here and even on its face it's nonsense for one reason at the time exact time the difference independence is from 1776 and the Constitution's from 1787 so they're close together but nevermind there are all kinds of state constitutions written at the same time as the Declaration of Independence some of them signed by people who also signed the Declaration of Independence and they're all like the Constitution the United States in in their structure which I'm going to talk about something that's important so another thing about it is that strikes me as particularly silly I've written a book about this is if you read the Declaration of Independence you will find that it comes in three parts and in the first part it states some universal principles very beautiful and in the second part it contains a bill of particulars in seventeen paragraphs about bad stuff the King of England did which bad stuff justifies the making of America throwing off the old government and adopting a new one and those things are remarkably like the Constitution United States what did the King do wrong well he interfered with the legislature which is a violation of the first step in all government the making of laws but also a violation of separation of powers which is crucial to how the Constitution United States worked so separation of powers is important and then he interfered with the people's ability to elect legislatures in other words representation a key feature of the Constitution of the United States and then he interfered with the judges he would ship people arrest them for crimes and ship them off to England where they couldn't be tried by a jury of their peers nor before judges who are independent of the executive branch which more or less the king was so you see they're writing the Constitution right there if you have a government that does these things then you are justified to rebel against that government and to kill anybody who resists you so it implies the Constitution now what kind of thing that they are different to that Christ Independence and the Constitution they serve different functions they also sound different in a very interesting way the difference independence is really beautiful you know when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands that have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature's God entitle them in that a grand expression the laws of nature and of nature's God it's written like that also it's not time bound when in the course of human events that means anytime in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people that means any people anywhere anytime the claim is what's gonna follow in this document is right at all times and so one way to think about the difference between the Declaration and the Constitution is it's a document about ultimate purposes what they call in classic philosophy final causes final causes are the things that we seek above all others the things we would die for and so the representor pence states those and of course those words echo around the world still today even when they're distorted you're gonna learn something about that in this course well the constitution is not quite like that the Constitution is it provides a form of government and when you read it hey you know I've regarded it as beautiful and think I understand why it's beautiful it has to do with its structure which Madison says is the most important thing about it but you know on any given passage right it's full of details like there's a list in article 1 section 8 things that Congress can do well post offices and post roads is among them it's hard to write a beautiful sentence about that no this is a document about how the government is going to work even how it's going to look it looks like a thing that operates in three branches if the if there's a interviews going on in front of the White House which there are everyday on the nightly news there's a picture of the White House in the background because that's where the president works and that's where executive things are done and if there's a if there's something big in the Congress then there's cameras looking up at the Capitol dome because that's where the Congress operates and where the legislation is made and the same for the Supreme Court building in operation the government looks like the Constitution and sure enough the first three articles in the Constitution one of them the first one sets up the legislative branch beginning with the words all legislative power herein granted and one thing you're going to learn in this course is that we don't make our laws through the Congress anymore that's why there can be so many of them and that's why it's impossible to hold to account those who make them except very indirectly and did it's even hard to find out who makes them I think there are a hundred and fifty lawmaking agencies in the federal government now so each of those clauses establish one two three the way the government of the United States looks and so if you think about it you couldn't have any serious activity that did not have a final cause a whole bunch of people cooperating sometimes it risks to their lives suffering and trouble sacrifice that started right at the beginning because the first thing that happened after the Detroits a dependence was we well actually it already happened a bit before we're having a war with England the greatest power on earth and to undertake that you need a big reason you need some ultimate reason and any time people think of their deaths they always think of what they live their lives for that's what the Declaration I'm in Independence is but then on the other hand if you're actually going to have a great government then there's gonna have to be ways for it to operate cuz think what it has to achieve it has to grant power the doctrine of the Detroits independence is that all legitimate power stems from those who are governed no other source but then somehow you've got to get some way to get legitimacy into the things that the government does and have that operate on a routine basis so if you're gonna have a legitimate government you're gonna have a form a recognized way by which it operates and so the Constitution provides that one you could say is the final cause and the other is the formal cause now I'm going to back up a step and ask a question that's prevalent today and that is why should you have any government at all what do you need it for and then we were just over in England as we're making this course and we were celebrating the completion of the official biography of Winston Churchill and there was a couple of young English guys who were working and helping us get around and they were delightful people and I got into long talks with them and they just made the point cuz you know they're having the big debate about whether they separate from the European Union over there or not and that young as a rule don't favor the separation and they said well we're not English we're European and I said dad what if you don't like something the European Union does oh there's a lot we don't like we want to see it reformed and I said good what means do you have to achieve that reform because it's kind of difficult isn't it there's 29 countries I think aren't they they don't all speak the same language how would you have a conversation with a wide body of fellow citizens to establish a thing like major reforms to the government and that's a point isn't it because in the Constitution well in the place in the Federalist Papers which are assigned to read along with this course and I urge you to read them and reread them because they're a great achievement in political thought one of the greatest and one of the greatest American such achievements and in the 51st Federalist Madison explaining why you have to build a constitution that that has precautions in it it has to grant power you have to have that but also it has to constrain power you have to have that and the way he puts the point is what is government but the profoundest of all reflections on human nature if men were angels no government will be necessary if angels were to govern men neither internal or external controls on the government would be needed see what that means he's locating us in the hierarchy of nature down at the bottom of the beasts are the rocks and up at the top are angels and God and if angels were being of being governed although there's a record in the Bible that their behavior is not perfect still it's true that is a common run is probably a lot better than ours and they don't they're imagined as as disembodied intellects and so they don't have all the needs and pressures we have and the beasts they just always obey instinct whereas we're moral beings which means we're called to do right and we don't always and that is actually the reason why we need laws but Madison just makes the common sense points the people who make the laws are people too how do we know they won't make them in their own interest well you need a constitution and it needs to be in control of the governed and so the reason nations and that word nation a comes from the Latin word not hora which means nature and that means that the making of laws is written in human nature and it actually precedes Aristotle says from our ability to talk because the that's a pregnant thing about us that's the big thing about us and so this need for government is fundamental and on the other hand we need to be able to control it and Nations therefore are conceived as natural things where people can understand each other they say they share a common final cause as in the Declaration of Independence which tells us what our nation is for and then they can cooperate with each other to a point and manage a government that responds to their will so it's actually true then isn't it that in this age where we rescuing nationalism for internationalism the detrás independence talks about that and mark the point I've already made it the pursue dependence begins universally it says that everybody has rights every human being the same in every age no matter where and then it says that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed in other words this universal rights that we have they call for government to protect those rights and they call for a kind of government that will be responsive to us it's a remarkable thing I think it's hard to quarrel with the assertion which I make all the time that the greatest of the modern countries is the United States of America well its story is tremendous right because it begins with a new world nobody knew where it was nobody knew what it was until about 18 6 I think it was nobody really knew how big it was nobody gone across the new world and all the way back until about then Lewis and Clark so something happened on this new land and what was it they picked up a civilization it's like in the western movies you know they're often a contest between somebody who's got a law book and somebody who's got a gun and in the towns where the westerns take place there's no capacity at all to produce either a law book or a gun but they know about them because they've come from a well developed civilization and brought it out to the frontier that's what the whole Western movies are just recreations of American history because the civilization mostly of Europe with its understanding of God and its understanding of right and it's learning and its understanding of nature that comes over here and those people brought all that in their minds and hearts what they didn't bring was aristocracy they didn't bring an established elite to run everything what they brought instead was ideas of freedom and equality and so there was this new world and a bunch of people got to take it over and they had because you know the first settlements are about a hundred and fifty years before the Declaration of Independence and that 150 years was a time of great learning one of the most remarkable things that was learned was that most of the early settlers came because of religious persecution and they thought the solution to that was to set up communities where their religion was installed by law and protected and everybody had to practice it and they thought it's a big old country if somebody doesn't like it they can go somewhere else so religious conformity was more or less the rule early on though the idea came to be we don't really have to fight about that first of all we do find a lot about it they were they used to in Massachusetts Bay Colony they used to hang Quakers for coming to town to try to convert people to Quakerism and Quakers or Christians you know different brand and so they thought that through and in the course of that hundred and fifty years they adopted the idea of civil and religious freedom and that's in the deck Royce of Independence right because life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that has to do including with our duty to God and so that religion should be respected but also free that's born that's reaches its perfection in the Declaration of Independence god I should say occurs four times in the Declaration of Independence and it's an interesting thing because it it demonstrates the way they talk of him how important God is and it demonstrates also how important limited government is because God appears first is the maker of the laws of nature nature's God the legislator then he appears as the supreme judge of the world the judge and then he appears as divine providence the executive branch and then he appears up higher up in as the creator or the founder of all things right and the lesson of the difference of Independence is one God is a standard greatly to be respected and worshipped and understood but - you wouldn't combine all those powers in the hand of any any being except God not for men so you see this tremendous opportunity which I can't see myself how would ever be repeated in history because there isn't a new world anymore maybe space but there's nowhere to go like that anymore and so they went there and they got a fifty years to work on it and then they proclaimed a regime defined by these two documents that's one of the most important events in human history in my opinion I say a thing or two about the Constitution because that's important first of all I mentioned that it's divided into groups and there are seven articles in the Constitution United States and the first three set up the three branches of government but then a second thing about it's interesting and that is that it's not an unlimited government there's something called the police power which comes from English common law very old and it's the general authority to legislate for the health safety and welfare of the people state governments in America I have that and that means that if the state if a state government tries to do something you know there are provisions and state constitutions and in the Federal Constitution that forbid them to do many things but the presumption is they have the power to do it if it fits within that common law definition which is very wide whereas the Constitution the United States delegates certain powers to the federal government and just think what a different thing in kind that is like Hillsdale College has Articles of Incorporation and they're very beautiful by the way and we follow them here closely but when it comes to the operation of the colleges it basically grants us the board and me and the staff here power to do anything a college needs to do well the federal grammar is not like that the federal government has article one section eight and and that's a limit on the government you see the the clauses are it's not hard to state what they're about is about National Defense the big job of the federal government the second biggest group is provisions to guarantee a system of national Commerce all over the nation one nation as regards economics contracts are to be respected bankruptcy there's to be a provision for them so that you have to be a legal process before you can get out of your debts but there should be such a process money weights and measures it's gonna be a great nation trading freely inside its borders and that will make the nation strong and nations need to be strong in order to defend themselves and the only other things that are powers given to the federal government are basically to operate in the States on the ground where the federal government has installations so the post office is Federal Territory and the Federal Building there way too many of those now but there's a provision for them right from the beginning so it's a limited government and whatever it does it has to justify by a specific provision in the Constitution that permits it and that's not the strictest rule in the world you know there's leeway but but it's a different kind of thing than to begin on the basis you can do whatever you please the last thing I'll say about the Constitution is what's it trying to do we like to say today if we're conservative minded people which I happen to be that the Constitution is to limit the government but of course that's obviously not true the first thing in this is in power of the government and it's it's all over the Constitution and the documents surrounding it that everybody understood they need a strong government in fact the Constitution itself which replace the Articles of Confederation was written in part because the Articles were failing and the reason they were failing was the government wasn't strong enough to protect our rights there were foreign troops on our soil and we couldn't do anything about it couldn't pay our debts they were riots in the States and they couldn't be put down Madison writes all this up in a really great essay before the Constitutional Convention called vices of the political system of the United States it's in our Constitution reader and so they need a stronger government but they divide it now what is the purpose of the division and you have to think about how profound the division is although it's been much overcome by the growth of the administrative state and the bureaucracy which you're going to hear a lot about in this course it's still true that it's a it's a tremendous achievement because in dividing the powers they arranged for different methods of election of the different parts so the president serves for four years the house representatives serves for two the Senate serves for six the judges are appointed by the President on advice of the Senate the constituencies are different the constituency for a senator is a state the constituency for the president is an electoral college made up of they which you win by majority that's under pressure these days which you win by majority of the electors in in the states and the electors are calculated according to the number of Senators and Representatives each state has so you see what it does it spreads Authority across space and you remember this is the greatest and most extensive Republic in human history and they were trying to unite a continent the full size of which they did not quite know yet although George Washington did name his army the Continental Army so they wanted spread and so the Senate spreads political authority and that means people who live in the very different and widely separated parts of the country all get a say even if they're not very numerous and then on the other hand it spreads Authority across time because if you want to change something in the American government the fastest you can possibly turn the whole government is six years because it takes three elections to elect a whole Senate and the president 2/3 of that amount of time so that means that it places a premium on opinions that we hold firmly and for a long time and Madison makes this point beautifully in the Federalist Papers and more than once in the 49th I think it is he says it is our reason alone that must be placed in control of the government our passions must be controlled by it so we're supposed to think before we act here's another feature of the Constitution in the 63rd Federalist Madison says that this is the first purely representative government in history he's claiming a uniqueness and what does he mean by purely representative he means that sovereign sovereign in England was the king and he was the executive branch the sovereign sovereign in Athens was the free citizens and they were the legislative branch sovereignty the sovereign in America is the constitutional majority but they don't occupy a branch of government we don't control I mean they've introduced the referendum things like that in later years but there's no federal referendum process why Madison thought it would be good for us because you know just like you can't trust the government fully because they're people you can't trust us fully either because we're people too and so we can only act through elections that makes elections important in America and it also means we can't do anything by the spur of the moment the best decisions not being made on the spur of the moment and our state of telling exception to that too the president is specifically empowered to act alone and that's in matters of execution think of the different meanings of that term execution when you've got a war you to act suddenly but laws prevail because of course if the president starts a war and the Congress doesn't like it or if he sends a bunch of troops somewhere they don't have to supply any money for that and the money will run out if they will put a stop to it and they have often in American history and threatened other times so you see the idea is that we have all the power but we can't act except through our representatives and that adds patients and and deliberation to the process and then a last thing the size of the of the United States the fact that it's spread so far the fact that it includes so many people in so many jurisdictions you know the states are supposed to have a lot more authority than they have these days and one of my wishes is to see it restored a lot of other things like that too but when it's spread all over the place let's say you've got ten little conspiratorial friends you know you can if you got ten little conspiratorial friends you can meet in dark rooms and whisper to each other and nobody need find out but what's ten gonna do in a country this says in fact to influence the country you have to cry you have to talk across millions of people hundreds of thousands in the founding millions now tens of millions now and you have to you have to speak across vast spaces and Madison rights that will teach us to be more candid with each other we you know we we love to say that all politicians are liars and I think that's not quite true but it's a rough truth but on the other end think how much worse it would be if they didn't have to talk in front of us and if they weren't free to contradict each other and I I want to close with this point because it's fundamentally important there are just two ways of governing human beings and one is by talking and the others by force because we are the speaking beings this rationality that we have that lets us use common nouns that's what makes us political and so legitimate political systems are always built on talking not on violence they may take violence to install they may require violence to persist than to defend but they must not proceed in their ordinary workings by violence of one citizen upon another and so we have a political system that first of all is met to potat protect our rights which are written in our nature the decisive part of which is our ability to reason and talk but also we have a nation where we're supposed to discuss things and teach each other and learn from each other and I'll go back to the European Union the poles and the Czechs and the English and the French don't really have a good way to talk to each other except through the agencies of the European Union and that means it's very difficult for there to be a culture in which public opinion is formed freely among all of the people who are affected they can't speak with each other routinely their translation programs and lots of people speak more than one language in Europe and yet to talk in your native tongue the tongue in which you've been educated and by which you articulate your best thoughts that's what you do especially with fellow citizens it's become a very great country in the course of its history beyond the imaginings even of the people who founded it who were extremely ambitious people they had the highest possible hopes all right well if that's true there must have been some cause of it but also it's in that final purpose we serve that we have adopted it's a purpose available to all human beings we have adopted it for our own and then finally in this form of government we have under the Constitution which is itself a reflection of human nature and that is why it has worked so well so I'll close with the editorial point well known I think we are doing restore the authority of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence thank you. 
The next major model that develops in reaction to the Structuralists is the Behaviorist School. And as we see in slide 16, there are many players that will be involved in this school. There’s some that I’ll just list here, Watson, Rescorla, Hull and many, many, many, many others. But Behaviorism, as a school of psychology, did not really develop until Watson’s publication of “Psychology as a Behaviorist Views It. ” For Watson, as we see in slide 17, the only legitimate object of psychological study was objective behavior. That is, what you can see. Don’t give me this elementary element of consciousness stuff, says the Behaviorists. How do you know what it is? It’s not objective. Science really can’t study the mind. You can’t study consciousness, images, or whatever because they’re not really observable. Instead what you should try to do is study objective behavior. So the goal for Watson and behaviorists, as we see in slide 18, was to make psychology an objective science, and discover particular laws that could predict the behavior. Ultimately if we can predict it, we can control behavior. As a result, we can use animals to discover the basic laws. Based on the concepts of evolution, if the same laws hold in animals or we discover a law in animals, it should hold in humans. That’s exactly what we have found. In addition to that, says the behaviorists, we can break complex behaviors down into simple behaviors, not subjective thoughts, but behaviors. And when you break these complex behaviors down into simple ones, you can find basic things that work with that. Now Watson’s model; Watson does not deny that the mind exists. In fact, the mind does exist for Watson. The key here with the behaviorists and Watson in particular, is that you cannot study it objectively. And until you can study it objectively, you shouldn’t really put much emphasis in studying it at all. Now other individuals after Watson came along, and some individuals before Watson will also have an impact in the Behaviorist school. These are the classic theorists in what we will call Instrumental Conditioning. The Instrumental Conditioning folks are Behaviorists, but they concentrate in a particular area of psychology and that will be called instrumental conditioning. As we can see on slide 20, there are several major players that occur in this group. They include Thorndike and Hull, which will have a huge impact, and their students Spence, Miller and Dollard and many others during that time. Basically, instrumental conditioning focused on how stimuli influenced responding. What was the thing that influenced the particular response that was out there?
In the last sections we have examined a wide variety of aspects related to classical and operant, and instrumental conditioning. In this section we begin talking about the last major and the current model of learning that is pretty much used by a lot of people today. These are called cognitive models. So, let’s begin by looking at some of the theorists of cognition which is shown on slide two. As you can see, a lot of the theorists of cognitive psychology relate all the way back to Plato. They include people like Tollman, Hull, and a variety of other people such as Anderson. In the last sections that we’ve talked about within instrumental and operant conditioning, we talked about some kind of stimulus causing some kind of response. And then following the response by some consequent stimulus. It depended upon the particular approach that one took whether one focused on the initial stimuli or the consequent stimuli following a response. In cognitive models, what is focused on is not the consequent stimulus or the initial stimulus, but what is going on inside the organism. We will talk about and label that stimulus with an O. So, what goes on inside the organism is the most important thing for cognitive theorists. So what kind of internal variables are investigated with different cognitive models of learning. These are listed on slide four. (For example, locus of control, expectancy, etc. ). So, let’s look at some of these variables a little more closelyThe first of these is locus of control and is shown on slide five. In essence locus of control is defined as how much control an individual feels they have over their environment. For Locus of control, the important point is where the control is. For example, if an individual feels they have no control over their environment, (that is they have little connection between the behavior and the rewards), they have what is called a high external locus of control. That is, everything outside of them controls what is going on with their behavior. Well, individuals with high internal locus of control basically believe that the world is responsive to my actions. That is, everything occurs because of what I do.
