The next major model that develops in reaction to the Structuralists is the Behaviorist School. And as we see in slide 16, there are many players that will be involved in this school. There’s some that I’ll just list here, Watson, Rescorla, Hull and many, many, many, many others. But Behaviorism, as a school of psychology, did not really develop until Watson’s publication of “Psychology as a Behaviorist Views It. ” For Watson, as we see in slide 17, the only legitimate object of psychological study was objective behavior. That is, what you can see. Don’t give me this elementary element of consciousness stuff, says the Behaviorists. How do you know what it is? It’s not objective. Science really can’t study the mind. You can’t study consciousness, images, or whatever because they’re not really observable. Instead what you should try to do is study objective behavior. So the goal for Watson and behaviorists, as we see in slide 18, was to make psychology an objective science, and discover particular laws that could predict the behavior. Ultimately if we can predict it, we can control behavior. As a result, we can use animals to discover the basic laws. Based on the concepts of evolution, if the same laws hold in animals or we discover a law in animals, it should hold in humans. That’s exactly what we have found. In addition to that, says the behaviorists, we can break complex behaviors down into simple behaviors, not subjective thoughts, but behaviors. And when you break these complex behaviors down into simple ones, you can find basic things that work with that. Now Watson’s model; Watson does not deny that the mind exists. In fact, the mind does exist for Watson. The key here with the behaviorists and Watson in particular, is that you cannot study it objectively. And until you can study it objectively, you shouldn’t really put much emphasis in studying it at all. Now other individuals after Watson came along, and some individuals before Watson will also have an impact in the Behaviorist school. These are the classic theorists in what we will call Instrumental Conditioning. The Instrumental Conditioning folks are Behaviorists, but they concentrate in a particular area of psychology and that will be called instrumental conditioning. As we can see on slide 20, there are several major players that occur in this group. They include Thorndike and Hull, which will have a huge impact, and their students Spence, Miller and Dollard and many others during that time. Basically, instrumental conditioning focused on how stimuli influenced responding. What was the thing that influenced the particular response that was out there?
	Back	 Transcript of Audio LectureIn the last sections we have examined a wide variety of aspects related to classical and operant, and instrumental conditioning. In this section we begin talking about the last major and the current model of learning that is pretty much used by a lot of people today. These are called cognitive models. So, let’s begin by looking at some of the theorists of cognition which is shown on slide two. As you can see, a lot of the theorists of cognitive psychology relate all the way back to Plato. They include people like Tollman, Hull, and a variety of other people such as Anderson. In the last sections that we’ve talked about within instrumental and operant conditioning, we talked about some kind of stimulus causing some kind of response. And then following the response by some consequent stimulus. It depended upon the particular approach that one took whether one focused on the initial stimuli or the consequent stimuli following a response. In cognitive models, what is focused on is not the consequent stimulus or the initial stimulus, but what is going on inside the organism. We will talk about and label that stimulus with an O. So, what goes on inside the organism is the most important thing for cognitive theorists. So what kind of internal variables are investigated with different cognitive models of learning. These are listed on slide four. (For example, locus of control, expectancy, etc. ). So, let’s look at some of these variables a little more closelyThe first of these is locus of control and is shown on slide five. In essence locus of control is defined as how much control an individual feels they have over their environment. For Locus of control, the important point is where the control is. For example, if an individual feels they have no control over their environment, (that is they have little connection between the behavior and the rewards), they have what is called a high external locus of control. That is, everything outside of them controls what is going on with their behavior. Well, individuals with high internal locus of control basically believe that the world is responsive to my actions. That is, everything occurs because of what I do.
