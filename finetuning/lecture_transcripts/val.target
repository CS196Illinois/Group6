These are called cognitive models. As you can see, a lot of the theorists of cognitive psychology relate all the way back to Plato. Conscientiousness is another personality variable that’s examined. (For example, locus of control, expectancy, etc. ). And then following the response by some consequent stimulus. So in general when we look at cognitive psychology and cognitive learning, what we look at are internal events that are out there. And basically these internal events are all examined within cognitive models. In the last sections that we’ve talked about within instrumental and operant conditioning, we talked about some kind of stimulus causing some kind of response. So what kind of internal variables are investigated with different cognitive models of learning. So individuals with high self-efficacy believe that they can succeed at anything, whereas individuals with low self-efficacy believe that they can’t succeed at anything at all. In the last sections we have examined a wide variety of aspects related to classical and operant, and instrumental conditioning. Well, individuals with high internal locus of control basically believe that the world is responsive to my actions. 
Today we will focus on two particular types of groups: what sociologists call “ingroups” and “outgroups. ” Let’s clarify the definitions of each type of group, and then we’ll look at some examples. In the last class, we discussed the nature of groups: how they are formed, and what characteristics they have in common. In other words, one person’s ingroup is another person’s outgroup. An example of an ingroup could be a person’s family, or a close group of friends. The ingroup may magnify, or emphasize, certain characteristics that make them distinctly different from the outgroup. Members of an ingroup may all dress in a similar style, or listen to similar music, or use a similar way of speaking—they may even have their own specialized words for certain things. Members of an ingroup may feel a sense of difference or separateness from the outgroup. Destroying the objects and symbols associated with one group can be a way of imagining that they are destroying the group itself. However, ingroups typically define themselves not just in relation to the members of that group, but in relation to other groups that are different from the ingroup. These are people with whom you feel a close attachment or connection, with whom you identify strongly. During the conflict in Iraq, for example, a statue of Saddam Hussein was toppled and dragged through the streets as a symbol of an outgroup. This leads to an “us versus them” mentality, that, in turn, can increase any existing conflict even as it strengthens the ingroup’s sense of identity. Outgroups help to define ingroups by providing the ingroup with a sense of identity against or in opposition to them. It’s important to clarify, however, that the symbol itself isn’t the cause of the conflict—it’s the meaning attached to the symbol, a point at which members of an ingroup can express their identity as distinct from the outgroup, and a point at which the ingroup can act out its emotions toward an opposing group. They may even feel a strong sense of opposition or conflict with the outgroup—or even hatred. 
The objectives for today are to teach a few more commands in bash, go over logical operators, go over text editors, go through aliasing, and potentially (as a bonus) go through bash scripting. The sudo command is used to give the user root privileges, which are more or less administrator privileges. BE CAREFUL WITH THIS. sudo can delete important files. The echo command is used to print into Bash and is useful when determining errors within long commands. The find command is a powerful command used to locate files, and it can be used with the -name flag followed by a file to find the path to specific files and the -delete flag to delete found files. The grep command is used to search for text and return matching lines in a given file, using the -w flag will return exact matches, and using the -i flag will make the search case insensitive. The diff command is used to compare two files line by line and identify the lines where they differ. && is an and logical operator and lets you do commands sequentially. II is an or logical operator, and it will try the first command and if it fails, it will do the second. The ssh command is used to log into and do operations on a remote machine. There are many different text editors in Bash. vim is a terminal editor which opens in command mode with many keys. You can use -i to enter insert mode. In order to exit vim, you need to return back to command mode. Another text editor is known as emacs, which is similar to vim. The important keys are ctrl, the meta key, and esc which are combined with a variety of different keys. Another text editor is nano. Aliasing is a tool used to create bash shortcuts. Scripting is used within bash. You can run scripts by typing bash followed by script name dot sh. You can create a variable by declaring it and choosing a variable name. -eq is an equals operator for numerical comparisons and -ne is a not equals operator for numerical comparisons. == is an equals operator for Strings and != is a not equals operator for Strings. Loops are useful. Functions are useful as well. 
England defeats the Spanish Armada in 1588. England was a Protestant country, and it had different types of colonies. A joint stock company is where stockholders invest in a company and share in the potential profits or losses from the colony. A proprietorship is land given by the king to an individual or group. A royal colony is paid for and ruled directly by the monarchy. The colony of Roanoke fails in 1587. The Chesapeake colonies were Virginia and Maryland. The first permanent English Colony in North America was established at Jamestown in 1607 for wealth under the joint stock company the Virginia Company. Many of the original settlers died of disease and starvation. John Smith established military discipline and saved the colony. John Rolfe introduced tobacco. In colonial Virginia, tobacco provided the colony with a cash crop and led to the rise of the plantation system. They needed a cheap labor supply, so indentured servants served as the early labor force of Virginia, meaning they worked for a period of time in exchange for passage to the colony. The headright system said that you get land if you paid for somebodyÕs journey to the colony. The House of Burgessess was established in 1619 and was a form of early representative government. Problems began to develop, as tobacco destroyed land, demand for labor and land goes up, tensions increase with natives as colonists move west. A very hostile relationship developed between the colonists and the Powhatan tribe. Tensions increased as settlers moved west. The Anglo-Powhatan Wars happened between 1610-1646. The first war ends in 1614 between Pocahontas and John Rolfe. The Massacre of 1622 begins the 2nd war. By 1624, Jamestown becomes a royal colony. The Powhatan Confederacy was largely defeated by 1646 because of disease, disorganization, and disposability. The first Africans arrive in the colony in 1619. BaconÕs Rebellion occurred in 1676. This was due to a lack of land, lack of political power, and a lack of action on Native American attacks. Nathaniel Bacon leads a rebellion against Indians on the frontier and burned Jamestown. This leads to a transition to African Chattel Slave Labor, which demonstrates tension in colonial society between social classes and regions. Another Chesapeake colony was Maryland which was a proprietorship led by Lord Baltimore. The Act of Toleration of 1649 guaranteed religious freedom for all Christians. There were multiple Southern colonies. South Carolina was a cash crop plantation economy with wealthy aristocratic elite and African slave labor. North Carolina had small tobacco farmers and less of a reliance on slavery. Georgia served as a buffer colony against Spanish and French threat. 
The mechanical universe is a vast, mechanical universe with all kinds of different forms. From the smallest particle to the largest cluster of galaxies we look at how does it all work. What keeps it all going whether it's speeding up slowing down changing direction or cruising straight ahead. Western civilization had fallen into line behind the endless circular argument of the photonic ideal. Galileo's findings are not only correct they come down through history as an amazing example of the scientific imagination at work. Johannes Kepler envisioned the parabolic paths of projectiles as well as the law of falling bodies. Kepler was destined to remain on the threshold of the mechanical universe. Isaac Newton destroyed the age-old machinery of the Aristotelian universe. All it takes is a little differential calculus while Newton's calculus goes far and wide throughout the mechanical universe. 
If you have a government that does these things, then you are justified to rebel against that government and to kill anybody who resists you. Government is divided into groups and there are seven articles in the Constitution, United States and the first three set up the three branches of government. If it fits within that common law definition, which is very wide, whereas the Constitution, the United States delegates certain powers to the federal government and just think what a different thing in kind that is like Hillsdale College - has Articles of Incorporation and they're very beautiful. The federal government has article one section, eight and and that's a limit on the government. The Constitution itself, which replace the Articles of Confederation was written in part because the Articles were failing and the reason they were failing was the government wasn't strong enough to protect our rights. 
The Behaviorist School developed in reaction to the Structuralists. The major players were Watson, Rescorla, Hull, and many others. The Behaviorist's goal was to make psycology an objective science and discover particular laws that could predict behavior. They also thought that we can break down complex behaviors into simple behaviors. They believed that you cannot study the mind objectively. 
The first variable is locus of control which is defined as how much control an individual feels they have over their environment. A high external locus of control means that everything outside of an individual controls what is going on with their behavior. Individuals with high internal locus of control believe the world responds to their actions.
