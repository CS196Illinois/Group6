The Behaviorist School developed in reaction to the Structuralists. The major players were Watson, Rescorla, Hull, and many others. The Behaviorist's goal was to make psycology an objective science and discover particular laws that could predict behavior. They also thought that we can break down complex behaviors into simple behaviors. They believed that you cannot study the mind objectively. 
The first variable is locus of control which is defined as how much control an individual feels they have over their environment. A high external locus of control means that everything outside of an individual controls what is going on with their behavior. Individuals with high internal locus of control believe the world responds to their actions.
