In the last section, we examined some early aspects of memory. In this section, what we’re going to do is discuss some factors that influence memory. So let’s do that by beginning with the concept on slide two, and that concept is overlearning. Basically in overlearning, the idea is that you continue to study something after you can recall it perfectly. So you study some particular topic whatever that topic is. When you can recall it perfectly, you continue to study it. This is a classic way to help when one is taking comprehensive finals later in the semester. So when you study for exam one and after you really know it all, you continue to study it. That will make your comprehensive final easier. The next factor that will influence memory relates to what we call organization. In general, if you can organize material, you can recall it better. There are lots of different types of organizational strategies and I’ve listed those on slide four. So let’s begin by talking about the first organizational strategy called clustering and is located on page five. In clustering, basically you recall items better if you can recognize that there are two or more types of things in a particular list. So let’s give a couple of lists and show you some examples of that. These examples are shown in slide six. Let’s say that I give you the first list; north, cardinal, south, robin, east, wren, west, sparrow. Now if you can recognize that north, south, east and west are points on a compass and cardinal, robin, wren and sparrow are birds, then you have a higher probability of recalling that material than if you just tried to recall the list in order. The same occurs with the second list that is located on the right hand side of page six. So let’s list these words as well; pig, cat, horse, dog, sheep, birds, cow, and fish. Now if you can recognize that these are two groups of animals; one being farm animals and the other being domestic companions, ala, pets, then you can recall that list of material better than if you just tried to recall the list in order. So again, this is another type of example of organizational strategy. Now there are other organizational strategies that one can use as well. The next one of these, as we see on slide seven, are what are called verbal pneumonic techniques. In verbal pneumonic techniques, you make your own organization and there are many, many different types of techniques. So let’s talk about the first of these on slide eight and that is called acrostics. In acrostics these are phrases in which the first letter of each word functions as a cue to help you recall some piece of information. There are a variety of different acrostics that one uses. The most famous of these relates to this saying: On Old Olympus Towering Tops A Fin And German Vented Some Hops. These relate to the twelve different cranial nerves that we have within the brain and if you are a traditional medical student or taking anatomy and physiology, this is the acrostic that you usually use to remember them. Now there are other verbal pneumonic techniques as well. So let’s take a look at another one of those and is located in slide 10. These are called acronyms. Acronyms are basically a word formed out of the first letters of a series of words. A classic example of an acronym system is ROY G BIV which are the first letters of the colors in the visual spectrum. This is the classic acronym that all sensation and perception students and even introductory psych students learn to memorize. Another verbal pneumonic technique is shown on slide 11 and called Rhymes. The classic rhyme is one that you had learned in grade school is I before E except after C. So rhymes are another way to recall and memorize information. So now we’ve examined a variety of different verbal pneumonic techniques and how they work. In this next section, we’re going to examine some visual imagery types of methods to organize material. The first of these is shown in slide 13 and is called the Method of Loci. Basically it involves taking some kind of an imaginary walk along some familiar path where images that you’re trying to recall are associated with some items or locations along the path. The classic example of where we put material is in your house. So just close your eyes and think about this. What happens when you walk in your back door? What’s the first item that you see. Well the first item that you see is where you put the first piece of information that you want to remember. Let’s say that it is a coat hook, so you hang something on the coat hook. Then you continue on into the kitchen. In the kitchen, what’s the first thing that you see? Well it may be the refrigerator, and so you identify the second item that you’re trying to remember and put it on the refrigerator. Then you open the door in the refrigerator and that’s where you put your third item. And then you close the refrigerator door and you look to your left and there’s the stove. So, you put the next item on one of the burners of the stove and on and on until you have all the items that you are trying to remember located within the kitchen or within the house. Then when you’re trying to recall the items during the exam, you begin your walk around the house. So the first thing you think about is what happens when I walk in the back door and lo and behold, there’s the first item I’m trying to recall. Then I go to the refrigerator and there’s the second item. Then I open the door of the refrigerator and there’s the third item and on and on until I have all the different materials that I’m trying to remember put down for my exam. Now walking around the house is a good place to use the method of loci, but there are other places that’s even better. The better place to try and place all the information you want to learn is in the location where you’re going to have to recall the material. So sitting in the exam room where you’re going to take the test and putting all those things on different objects within the exam room is a good strategy. Especially if one is trying to memorize lots and lots of different information because each of those places acts as a cue. So that’s the first type of visual imagery technique. Now the second type of visual imagery technique is shown on slide 14. This is called the pegword technique. The pegword technique relies on a list of integers. What you do is attach a pegword to each of the numbers with rhymes. The classic example is One rhyming with Bun, Two and Shoe, Three and Tree, Four and Door and on and on. Then as we see in slide 15, when you’re given a list of words to recall, you associate the first word in the list with the peg word. For example you have a word, let’s say you’re trying to recall the word “Bee” and the peg word is bun. Well what you might try to do is visualize a bee eating a great big bun. As a result of that, you make associations. Furthermore, the more outrageous the association, the better the recall is for the particular item. So, let’s say that you might have a frog with shoes on, and a horse knocking down a tree, or whatever it may be to the information that you’re trying to recall. So these are the first two techniques (overlearning, organization) that relate to factors that influence memory. What’s the next major factor? Well, the next major factor is shown on slides 16 and 17 and that is the order in which you learn things. If I give you a list of words in a serial learning task or a free recall task, you have better recall for words at the beginning and end of a list but not in the middle of a particular list. That is called the Serial Position Effect. There’s a couple different things you need to note about the serial position effect. First recall at the beginning of the list is what is called the Primacy Effect and recall for the end of the list is called the Recency Effect. The recency effect occurs because you can generally only recall seven plus or minus two items in working or what is also called short term memory. We’ll talk about that in more detail a little bit later. Now the serial position effect is shown in the graphical figure on slide 19. As we can see when we start to memorize a list of words, we usually start about 60 to 65% accuracy. In the recency phase, at the last word that we’re trying to recall we have a percent recall rate of about 85 to 90% depending on the study. Note within the middle of the list that you’re trying to look at you only have about a 20% chance of recalling a particular set of items. So the serial recall effect is extremely important for how you try to memorize things. For example, if you were studying three chapters for learning, as what we might have here, and you always start with the first chapter in order (so you start with chapter one, then two, then three), you will have fairly good recall for chapter one, you’ll have some decent recall also for chapter three but chapter two you won’t remember at all. So a better way to memorize that material is to change the order in which you’re learning the material. So you start one day with chapters one, two, and three in that order, then you go with two, three, and one; and finally, three, one and two, and on and on. What this does is help you raise the level of the middle section within the recency of effect. So, within the serial learning effect, what you should do is vary the order so you have good recall of information. Now there’s another variable that goes along with the serial position effect and is shown on slide 20. It is called the Von Resterhoff Effect. Basically when a word is in the middle of a list that is surprising or funny or dirty, you will usually recall that particular word and some of those around it. So let’s give an example of that in the following slide. Look on slide 21 at the list of words. What I’d like you to do is try to recall the words in order. So, take a minute to do that. Now that you have memorized and tried to recall the words, look in the middle of the list. Basically what happens is that everybody will recall the word “intercourse” and usually a couple of words around it. So you might recall elephant and even suitcase. This effect is shown on slide 22. So, we have the same kind of effect that we saw with the serial learning task we began with on earlier slides. But we also see that in the middle of the list, we recall one or two particular words, then we drop off again before we have a recency effect (starting toward words 14 and 15). So again, the Von Resterhoff effect is an extremely important effect. You can use it to your advantage by putting surprising or interesting things in the middle of the list of material that you’re trying to memorize. Now the next factor that influences learning and memory is what we call proactive interference or what is also called proactive inhibition. Here is where your past learning will interfere with your ability to recall new material. Let’s give an example, if you learn list A, then you learn list B, and finally you have to recall B. In proactive interference, list A will interfere with your ability to recall list B. A classic example is shown on slide 24. You learn sociology then you learn psychology. Sociology will interfere with your ability to recall the psychology. To help keep it clear we have a little organizational scheme that kind of helps us. That is a classic acronym PABB. Proactive - You learn A, you learn B, then you recall B. Now sometimes your past learning will interfere with information retention or sometimes your past learning will help you because you learn to organize it better. We will talk about this in more detail in the next section. The next factor that influences memory is shown on slide 26 and that is what is called retroactive interference or retroactive inhibition. Unlike proactive interference, learning new material interferes with your ability to recall old material. That is, you learn list C, then you learn list D, then you have to recall C. Consequently, D will interfere with your ability to recall C. So let’s take an example of that. Here you learn psychology, then you learn sociology, and sociology will interfere with your ability to recall the psychology. So let’s take another example and use a more practical example. Let’s say that you’re learning psychology, (ala learning) and you’re going to take a test. You walk into the exam and you have about five minutes before the exam starts. So you take out a newspaper such as the Argonaut, which is our school newspaper and you start to read it. Consequently, the Argonaut will interfere with your ability to recall the psychology. Again we have another acronym and that is RCDC. Retroactive - you learn C, you learn D, then you have to recall the C. What are important things for you about proactive and retroactive interference from an applied standpoint. This is shown in slide 29. First of all, don’t take similar courses in the same semester. Take things that are different and that don’t have a lot of overlap. As a result you will recall all of them better. An example might be taking some sociology, some math, biology and computer science rather than taking sociology, psychology, anthropology, and maybe political science. If you do, things just get jumbled together. Now the next variable that’s going to influence learning is what is called active participation. In general, the more active you are during the learning cycle, the more you will recall, This is shown in slide 31. Quizzing yourself while you’re reading, determining how the material that you’re currently working with relates to other material, using study guides, outlining the chapters or notes, etc. , will significantly increase your recall of information. The major one these relates to highlighting and chapter outlining or reading. If you look at and see which gives you the better recall, there is no doubt about it that outlining your book chapter will give you better recall than highlighting or reading the book. Let’s just take the concept of highlighting. What are you doing when you highlight a piece of text, let’s say a paragraph or two. What are you doing when you’re doing that? Essentially, what you’re trying to do is keep the yellow or pink line going over the text. You are not really using the information or putting it into your brain system. Whereas if you are outlining some book chapter or some notes, what are you having to do. First, you have to read it, then you have to put it into some kind of verbal vocabulary. Once you have the verbal vocabulary, you have to write it on paper and make sure that it makes sense as you’re doing that. So, when you outline a chapter, you’re putting information into your brain four or five different ways, rather than putting it in and using one or two ways, such as with highlighting or even reading. Now the next variable that will impact learning is the similarity of the learning and recall condition. In general, the more similar the recall condition is to the learning condition, the better the recall. This is a classic example that is shown in slide 33. The ideal place to study for an exam is where, the room where you’re going to take the exam. Here you have all the cues. And the more similar it is, (everybody studying in the same room) the more information you recall. Now there’s a related concept that goes with the similarity of learning and recall condition and this is shown in slide 35. It is called state dependent learning. What state dependent learning basically says is this. “It’s best to recall information in the same drug state as you are when you’re doing the learning. ” So, as we see on slide 36, if you smoke, you need to smoke while taking your exam. If you drink coffee or coke while you’re studying, you need to drink coffee or coke while taking the exam. When I was in grad school many, many years ago, I drank a lot of Coca Cola, but I knew exactly how my body felt when I was taking the exam and when I was drinking the Coke while studying. If my Coca Cola level was off, I did poorer on the exam. Now a related variable is if you don’t study while drinking coffee, but take the exam on coffee, what happens? Well what happens is that you don’t recall as well (and the same is true with smoking). Since people aren’t allowed to smoke in auditoriums or wherever they are taking exams, it’s best not to smoke when you’re studying. Now this concept relates to a concept that is called test anxiety and in test anxiety, what you’re doing is something very similar, and this is shown in slide 37. In test anxiety, basically while you’re studying you tend to be relaxed, but when you’re taking the exam, you tend to get tense due to the stress of the exam. When you’re tense, what happens? Your blood pressure goes up, different hormones are released, etc. As a result, your mind goes “poof” and everything’s gone. Then what happens when you get done with the exam. You walk out, you begin to relax, and guess what happens, you can recall the information again. So, the best way to help yourself is to learn to stay relaxed while you’re taking your exam. If you have problems doing that, participate in a test anxiety workshop. There are a variety of those located at a variety of different settings. Furthermore, any good clinical or counseling psychologist can help you with that. Now the next variable that relates to factors that influence learning and memory relates to spaced practice being better than massed practice (or what is called cramming). This is shown on slide 39. In general, it’s better to spread out studying over a period of time instead of doing it all at once. Let’s give an example of that on slide 40. Basically studying three days for one hour is better than studying three hours all at once. That is, don’t cram for the exam. The question then becomes why? As we show in slide 41, the reason you have problems is because of the serial position curve. Generally you can only recall seven plus or minus two items in your memory, so when you’re cramming, basically what you’re doing is putting in information into your short term memory. Thus what you have is recalling of recency effect items. So in SUMM as we see here in the last few minutes is that there’s a variety of different factors that influence memory. Each of these factors is extremely important and ones that you should remember. In the next section, we’re going to begin to examine some early theories of memory and how those theories work. 
In the last section we were talking about some early models of memory and primarily the Atkinson and Shiffrin model. In this section we examine a variety of different brain structures that are involved with memory. So let’s talk about a few of these and get an idea about where they are and what they do. The first major structure that’s involved with memory is what is called the Hippocampus, and the Hippocampus plays a major role in encoding and storing information. When you damage the Hippocampus, you have problems with storing and recall. Tenerally the information is not appropriately coded due to insufficient types of elaboration. Thus, when you damage your Hippocampus (by a stroke or trauma) new information is not stored. However, your old information remains intact. This is called anterograde amnesia and often occurs with individuals who experience a stroke. They’ve damaged their Hippocampus and can’t remember new stuff but their old information still there. So, when they’re out wandering around after getting out of the hospital or they’re moved to a new facility. What happens when they get out on the street and they’re driving around? Where do they go? Well, they go back to their old place where they used to live. Now the second type of structure that’s involved with memory is shown on slide three and is called the Thalamus. The thalamus is also involved with memory formation. This structure is thought to initially give the message to print the message that you’re trying to remember. With damage, you never get memory traces. They’re never created. So the memory that you have is in neither in short term memory or long term memory. Basically; it never even gets there. So, as we see in slide four, when you damage the Hippocampus, the memories form but due to elaboration problems, it’s not properly encoded and so it goes away. But with damage to the thalamus, the memory never gets formed at all. The next major structure that we want to talk about with memory is called the Cerebellum. The cerebellum is extremely important for different types of physical memories and procedural memories. The classic study that shows this done by Thompson. What Thompson did was he conditioned an eye blink response and a leg movement response. He then lesioned the area that disrupted the eye blink response. As a resultt, the leg response was unaffected. But then he moved to the system of one millimeter closer to the middle of the brain and then lesions. As a result, he found that the leg response was affected but the eye blink response was not. Thus what you seem to have, says Thompson (and others as well), are specific systems and specific locations where you store different types of memories that are associated with physical pathways. So, as we see on slide six, we have isolated procedural memories that have unique pathways in the cerebellum. You also get the same kind of response when you remove the Hippocampus and other structures. The next structure that’s highly involved with memory, is your cortex and it has lots of different locations that are related to memory. Where the memory is stored tends to be related to the type of memory that’s involved. For example, movement memories and things like that tend to be involved with the precentral gyrus in the frontal lobe of the brain. Whereas sensory memory items tend to be involved with the postcentral gyrus located in the parietal lobe of the brain. But mostly when we talk about memories for knowledge and other things, we talk about structures within the frontal lobe, and association cortex within the frontal and temporal lobes. So again, memory is located in lots of different places within your cortex. It depends upon the type of memory that you are trying to memorize. Now the last slide that we see here (slide eight), kind of puts this all together. So let’s walk through the slide so we get an idea about the different structures that are involved with each aspect of memory. This is the same figure that we saw earlier in the last section. So, again we have some sensation and we get some kind of sensory memory. We then pay attention to that. Now two structures that pay attention to that. The first is the reticular activating system which basically helps to focus attention. The second is the thalamus, which we’ve already talked about. So the thalamus is basically going to develop some kind of memory trace, and the combination of both structures puts that information into short term memory. Within short term memory, we are processing information. If we’re going to store that memory into long term memory, the Hippocampus takes that memory in short-term memory and converts it into long-term memory located in your cortex. So, if we damage any one of these particular systems, whether the reticular activating system, the thalamus, the Hippocampus, or the cortex, we have particular types of memory problems. As a result, the neurologist or the neuropsychologist can examine what’s going on and get a pretty good idea about brain damage that you have within the system. So, a variety of brain systems are involved with memory and each of these are very, very important. In the next section, we’re going to be talking about another aspect of memory and these are what are called depth of processing models, so until that time, we hope that you enjoy your day. 
In the last section, we talked about a variety of models related to depth of processing. In this section we begin to talk about the last aspect of memory and that is retrieval, forgetting, and recall. So let’s begin with a discussion of forgetting which we start with slide two. The first question one must ask is, “How do we forget information? What happens?” There are many, many different types of theories to answer these questions and listed here. So let’s start talking about the first of these theories called decay theory. Decay theory, as we see in slide three, is very straightforward. That is, memory traces decay as time passes. The problem is there is little evidence to support decay theory. In addition, as we saw earlier, the Penfield studies show that we don’t have a lot of decay. Information remains in there for a long period of time. So what’s the second type of theory? Well, as we see in slide four, it is called interference theory. Again, interference theory talks about retrograde interference and proactive interference. In retrograde interference, new learning interferes with our ability to recall old information while proactive interference or old information interferes with our ability to recall new information. The theory contends that memory traces are lost as other memory traces occur before and after the stimulus is present. So, the information is basically blocked. Now another theory is shown in figure five. It relates to what we call retrieval cues. In general what happens say these theorists is that we have different retrieval cues. Thus we can’t recall the information from where it was before. So, if we have these problems, how accurate is memory? This begins in slide six. Essentially, memory is often inaccurate. The early studies of really drive home this point. Basically the classic study is by Easterbrook. What Easterbrook found is that as you change arousal in animals, they narrow their attention to particular things. That is a real good defense mechanism. So, for example, if you see the lion over there in the corner of the woods, you don’t really want to be focusing on other things such as the sky. And as that lion gets closer and closer you spend more and more attention to that stimulus. So when you are aroused you narrow your attention. Easterbrook also contends that humans tend to focus on just a few details and not the entire situation. He calls this the weapon of focus hypothesis. Now there’s a related aspect of this model and that is called the Yerkes-Dodson law. What the Yerkes-Dodson model (shown in slide seven) contends is that there’s an optimal level of arousal for any particular task. In essence performance is poorer at very low levels of arousal or very high levels of arousal. Thus, the optimal level of arousal is in the middle. So how does all of this stuff apply to memory? Well as we can see in slide eight, higher arousal leads to better retention. But not too much arousal. Because as your arousal increases, you become more and more narrowly focused. Thus you only encode smaller amounts of information. Thus in general, intermediate arousal is best for when you’re trying to recall something. So what are the implications for testing and when you take an exam? Well as you can see in slide nine, a little anxiety may actually increase your performance. However, if you have too much anxiety, it is detrimental to your performance. Now in addition to that, we have other aspects of memory. These are called flashbulb memories. Flashbulb memories are basically sudden significant events that people feel are in your minds forever. There are a variety of different ones out there. The Oklahoma City bombing, September 11 destruction of the World Trade Centers in New York, the Challenger explosion, Mt. St. Helen’s eruption, the Kennedy assassination, and Pearl Harbor are examples. In each of these events, you have are specific memories of what was going on in your mind and what you were doing during each of these particular times. Even today individuals can recall what they were doing when Pearl Harbor was attacked by the Japanese empire in the early 1940s. Flashbulb memories (as we see in slide 11) are also highly emotionally charged and people vividly recall many details of what was going on when they received the news; where they were, what they were doing, or whom they were with. The problem with these memories, is that they are often distorted. That is, some of the information is forgotten or even inaccurate. Now the way that you saw the information or the way that you receive the information will also have an implication for flashbulb memories. For example, were you there, or did you see it on TV. If you’re there, the accuracy actually increases. Thus, there may be special cases for increased accuracy under high stress conditions. The task used to recall information is also important when trying to recall information or get information out. As we discussed earlier, what kind of task are you trying to do? Are you getting a recall task where you have to memorize and flush it? Are you getting a recognition pass such as a multiple choice exam, or relearning task? So lets again review these. Again as we see in slide 15, a free recall task, you’re recalling words in any order. Again, it is very difficult. The classic example is a “fill in the blank” exam. It can be increased by pneumonic techniques and that can very specifically increase the number of words that you actually recall. Recognition tasks, again, as we see in slide 17, provide cues. The classic example is the multiple choice test. Again the cues can be anything, they can be words or pictures. The problem is, the more cues, the more difficult it is to recall. I multiple choice exams, the more choices that you have, the harder it is to recall the correct item. Thus a four item multiple choice exam for each question is much easier than an eight item multiple choice exam. Ultimately this relates to false alarms which are part of signal detection theory (which I’m not going to talk about in this section). Other problems relate to the cues that are provided. This is shown in slide 19. That is, , the cues will influence the kind of information that you recall. It also depends upon the distracters. Are they very close distracters in recognition tasks or are they very more distant distracters. Another aspect that will have an impact on memory is the mood the person is in. This is called the mood congruency effect. Eich and Metcalf studied subjects when they were recalled happy or sad words listening to happy or sad music. Basically what they found is the test words they had to recall were better when they matched a study mood. So, happy moods with happy music and sad words with sad music got better recall than when they were mixed. This is shown in slide 21. Basically, happy words with sad music or sad words with happy music had poor recall. Now, we have a couple of other memory aspects that we need to discuss. The first is what is called reconstructive memory. Reconstructive memory is something very simple. It is basically memories that people try to do inferentially from what they can recall. This can be extremely accurate. So let’s take an example. Tell me what this process is. I’m just going to read this statement. The procedure is quite simple. First arrange items into different groups, of course, one pile may be sufficient depending on how much there is to do. If you have to go somewhere else due to lack of facilities, that is the next step. Otherwise you’re pretty well set. It is important not to overdue things, that is, it is better to do too few things at once than too many. In the short run, this may not seem important but complications can easily arise and a mistake can be expensive as well. First the whole procedure may seem complicated. Soon, however, it will become just another facet of life. It is difficult to see any answer the necessity of this task in the immediate future, but then one can never tell and after the procedure is completed, one arranges the material in a different groups then they are placed in their appropriate places. Eventually the process will need to be repeated again, however, this is part of life. So what you need to do is, since I’ve provided some information to you think what the paragraphs are describing. You can enhance your recall if you provide information about the topic at the beginning of the material. That is, the recall is much better than after reading the material and then trying to figure out what it is. So, what is this simple thing that we have to do?Well as we can see in slide 25, it’s doing the laundry and once I say doing the laundry, all of those things that I just described a couple slides ago make a lot of sense. Now there’s inferential intrusions into recall. This relates to what we call explicit and implicit memories. Explicit memories are basically things that we are consciously aware of when we retrieve them, while implicit memories are memories of experiences you cannot consciously retrieve. So let’s give a couple examples. The first example is shown in slide 28. It is the feeling of knowing something, it’s on the tip of the tongue, such as you can almost recall someone’s name but you’re just not quite able to recall it. A second example can be where we are fairly accurate. This classic example occurs in game shows where we guess at the answer. Basically, we judge that we know the answer much faster than we can accurately recall. So in conclusion, there are lots of issues in relation to memory and cognition. As a result, issues related to memory and cognition have lots of implications for school, work load and other situations. 
Different cultures often have entirely different perceptions of time. The cultural anthropologist Edward T. Hall popularized the idea that cultures use time and view time in very different ways. The idea of the past, present, and future—and the whole concept of scheduling or managing time—can be so different that it leads to cross-cultural miscommunications. In Hall’s 1990 book The Dance of Life, Hall writes, “Time is one of the fundamental bases on which all cultures rest and around which all activities revolve. Understanding the difference between monochronic time and polychronic time is essential to success. ” Hall’s notion of monochronism and polychronism can be understood as follows. Monochronic time is linear. Events are scheduled one at a time, one event following another. To a monochronic culture, this type of schedule is valued over interpersonal relationships. On the other hand, polychronic time is characterized by many things happening simultaneously. In addition, interpersonal relationships are highly valued in polychronic cultures. Hall’s theory is that monochronic time can be found primarily in North American and Northern European cultures. These cultures emphasize schedules, punctuality, and preciseness. They also emphasize “doing” things. They are cultures that value productivity, that value getting things done “on time. ” They view time as something that can be lost, killed, or wasted—or, conversely, they view time as something that can, or should, be managed, planned, and used efficiently. Polychronic time, on the other hand, can be found primarily in Latin American, African, and Native American cultures. Their perception of time is more connected to natural rhythms. It is connected to the earth, to the seasons. This makes sense when we consider that natural events can occur spontaneously, sporadically, or concurrently. Polychronic cultures view time as being somewhat flexible. Since life isn’t so predictable scheduling and being precise simply isn’t that important. In addition, relationships with people are valued more than making schedules. There is more value placed on “being” than on “doing. ” Different cultural perceptions of time can lead to conflict, especially in the business world. The idea of being late versus on time for a meeting, for example, might differ widely between an American businessperson and a Brazilian; the American businessperson might be far less tolerant of a Brazilian’s late arrival. However, the Brazilian businessperson might be offended by an American’s insistence on punctuality or on getting right down to business; the Brazilian would generally prefer to finish talking with colleagues first, and would not want to cut a conversation short in order to make an appointment. Some traditional time management programs used in the business world might not translate well in another culture. Traditional time management programs in the business world emphasize to-do lists and careful scheduling. They are monochronic. However, a business in a polychronic culture might not adjust well to that system. Companies who impose these monochronic systems on places of business in polychronic cultures might be guilty of ethnocentrism, which means making their own ethnic or cultural values central and not valuing other values. Edward Hall’s theory of monochronic and polychronic cultures has been challenged by some critics. Some people think it is overly general. They argue that within any cultural group we might find people who think of time differently. In other words, a primarily polychronic culture might have both monochronic and polychronic types of people. The same diversity among individuals might be found in a primarily monochronic culture. Critics of anthropologists like Edward Hall feel that it’s more useful to think of time differences among individuals, not just between cultural groups. 
How important is it for people to contribute to society in some way? After the tragedy of 9/11, some people have become preoccupied with this question. Tragedies have a way of making people rethink their values and find a new focus. They make people think, on some level, about what a society needs in order to survive. Not just basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter, but deeper needs, relating to the health and values of society. Many people find themselves asking: how can I find more meaning in our society? What can I do to make a difference? For some, these questions may lead to practical decisions; others ask these questions and find themselves setting foot on a more spiritual path. The notion of doing something to take control of society or of our fate as humans is not something that developed just after 9/11. We might date this impulse back to ancient times, when the Greeks believed that humans were subservient to the gods, and that both gods and humans were powerless under fate. What was fated to happen was going to happen, and there was nothing that they could do about it. However, this way of thinking changed, arguably, with the rise of the great city of Athens. The social critic John Ralston Saul reminds us of how the Greeks constructed both new styles of buildings and new structures of civilization. The Greeks began to believe in the power of ingenuity, or the notion that creative, imaginative thinking could lead to humans’ ability to shape their own futures. They could use their own ingenuity, and the tools at hand, to make life better. They did not have to be subject to fate. Their thinking changed, in other words, from a passive approach to an active one. Perhaps somewhere in the late 20th century we began to lose sight of this active way of thinking. According to John Ralston Saul, the notion of “fate” returned with new faces— globalization, the market, or even technology. People in Western society began to feel powerless in the face of these large, looming forces that were shaping our society for us. Now, in the early 21st century, we may be seeing another change similar to the ones that the Greeks experienced, according to another cultural critic, Jon Spayde. In the wake of 9/11, perceiving a need for significant social change and new values, people who call themselves “social inventors” are trying to take back some control over society’s direction once again. A social inventor is not necessarily a social activist. An activist fights for social change. Nor is a social inventor a social contributor; a social contributor might be someone who supports social causes financially, or emotionally. And finally, a social inventor is not necessarily someone who works in a high-tech industry or invents new technologies and consumer products. A social inventor is different because he or she is using the power of ingenuity, or creative thinking, to come up with ideas for change in certain communities or sections of society. Social inventors have a vision of a better world and create new systems or practices. Their ideas may seem offbeat or impossible. Most social inventors are not famous or wealthy because of their inventions. They are usually quite ordinary people; they may even be people you know. Or we may never know who they are. But some of these creative thinkers have powerfully, and quietly, changed the way we live. Some examples of social inventions may sound familiar to you. The organization of “Alcoholics Anonymous,” a support group for people with addiction to alcohol, was founded in 1935 and has been going strong ever since. This was a social invention because an individual named Bill Smith, himself a recovering alcoholic, came up with a 12-step process for creating personal change. The idea caught on, communities and support groups formed around it, and millions of alcoholics have changed their lives ever since. Another example of a social invention is the organization Amnesty International, which was founded in 1961. A British lawyer named Peter Benenson wrote an editorial after two Portuguese students were imprisoned for toasting freedom in a café, and the international organization to support human rights began. Now millions of people around the world write letters to protest human rights violations. Social inventions do not have to be organizations, however. Sometimes they are new designs for neighborhoods or communities, allowing for more interaction among people. Sometimes they are systems, like new ways to help prisoners in jails receive an education or re-enter society. Sometimes they are very simple ideas, examples of new ways of thinking or “thinking outside the box” to solve problems. For example, some movie theatres in Boston and New York have recently started implementing a social invention to solve the problem of babies crying in movie theatres. To accommodate parents with babies, who would like to keep up with current movies, some theatres now offer special “mother’s hours,” a daytime showing of a film in which they are free to bring babies or young children. The lights are not turned down as low so that they can keep an eye on their children while they watch the movie. The idea of social inventions or social ingenuity has become so popular in recent years that “Idea Banks” of social inventions have shown up on the World Wide Web, books have been published on the subject, and Institutes have been founded. The Institute for Social Inventions, based in London, connects think tanks and idea banks throughout Europe. It has a website that invites ideas from anyone and that I’ll write here on the board: www. globalideasbank. org. You can search this website by category to see the types of ideas that ordinary people come up with. Looking at a wide range of them gives you some sense of the extent to which people desire to make a difference in our society and not remain powerless. 
Everyone experiences stress on some level every day. Stress, broadly defined, is our response toevents that we perceive as threatening or challenging. We may experience different levels ofstress depending on the stressors, meaning the events or circumstances that cause us to feel stress. Of course, not everyone perceives the same events or circumstances as stressful; we don’talways react the same way to the same stressors. In fact, something that is extremely stressfulfor one person may be exciting and non-stressful for another. In general, though, stressfulevents can be classified into three main categories: cataclysmic events, personal stressors, andbackground stressors. Cataclysmic events are major events that cause stress suddenly, immediately, for a great many people at once. Examples of these are earthquakes, fires, or other disasters. Personal stressors are major life events that create stress. They can include the death of a loved one, a job loss, a divorce, a financial setback, or a geographical move. They are not always events that we would perceive as negative; many “joyful” life events can also cause a greatdeal of stress. For example, getting engaged or married, acquiring a new family member(through birth or adoption), starting a new job, and even taking a vacation can all be as stressful as “negative” life events. Finally, background stressors—which we can also think of as dayto-day hassles, or minor irritations—can cause stress, particularly when they add up, when weare repeatedly exposed to them. Examples of background stressors are waiting in a long line,getting stuck in a traffic jam, being exposed to noise, experiencing a delay of some sort, ordealing with broken equipment. Examples of chronic background stressors—and the kind thatcan lead to long-term health problems—include being unhappy with one’s job, living environment, marriage, or relationship. Stress is not something that only exists in our mind. Repeated exposure to stressors hasboth psychological and biological consequences. When we are exposed to stressors, our adrenal glands secrete certain hormones, and our heart rate and blood pressure rise. We experience a “fight or flight” response, a sense of emergency, where the body prepares to defend itself. This is useful in some situations, especially where we might actually need to defend ourselves. In the long run, though, this activation of what is known as the sympathetic nervous system has negative effects and reduces our capacity to manage stress. When stress hormones are constantly secreted, and the body is continually preparing for emergencies, body tissues such as the heart and blood vessels can begin to deteriorate. The immune system functions less effectively, and reduces our ability to fight off illnesses. Some people who complain of repeated exposure tohighly stressful circumstances tend to report the following types of symptoms: aches and pains(headaches and backaches are common), skin rashes, digestive problems, and fatigue. The General Adaptation Syndrome, or G. A. S. , explains the sequence of physiological reactions to stress. There are three phases to G. A. S. The first is the “alarm and mobilization” phase. This is when we first become aware of a stressor. When we respond with alarm, we may feel upset or confused. We may even feel a sense of panic or fear. After that, however, we may begin to mobilize our efforts—in other words, to take action to remove the stressor. For example, if you received a mid-semester report stating that your grades were all very low, you might worry at first, but then you would probably make plans to reverse the situation, to improve your grades. It is during this first phase that the sympathetic nervous system is activated and the body responds with a sense of emergency. The second phase of G. A. S. is the resistance stage, which occurs if the stressor is not removed. This is the stage when we fight against the stressor or try to cope with the stressor. The attempt to mobilize and remove the source of stress from phase one can result in furtherstress. For example, if you were studying long hours to try to improve low grades, you mightsucceed in improving the grades but create more stress in the process. This can lead to the third G. A. S. phase: exhaustion. In this phrase, if resistance was not successful and stressors still exist, our ability to fight or cope with the stressor diminishes. At this point, symptoms of stress manifest themselves psychologically and biologically. Psychologically, we may become irritable, short-tempered, or unable to focus. There may be a sense of being completely overwhelmed and unable to function. Biologically, our bodies may react with such symptoms as aches and pains, fatigue, or illnesses. Interestingly, the exhaustion phrase may actually be an extreme way of trying to avoid the stressors. The body may be telling us that we need to take a break, that we need to do whatever is necessary to remove ourselvesfrom the stressor. 
okay let's get out of this all right hey everyone and welcome back to cs196 and welcome to python one so as we mentioned the start of the class we want to teach you concepts using python and rust we can't teach you those concepts unless you have a rough understanding of how the language is actually going to work so we're going to do the basics of python today and on thursday sammy's going to cover a few higher level concepts too so with that being said let's go over objectives so firstly we're going to go over what is python what is pythonic code that we're going to go over super quick setup info i'm not really going to touch on it too much but just in case you want to run the code alongside then we're going to cover quick hello world variables conditionals that loops functions lists and finally exception handling so a lot of this you might have seen already in 125 or if you've programmed another language you might have seen this already but we were covered in python and exception handling might be something new to you even if you have taken 125. so what is python well pretty basically it's a programming language in the end okay no we're going to go a little more in depth than that so you guys will have talking points interviews and stuff so python is an interpreted object-oriented high-level programming language with dynamic semantics okay that's a real mouthful this system exactly from the python documentation so let's actually go through this line by line and try to explain what that means so let's go through interpreted so interpretive languages are run by an interpreter which reads the code line by line so unlike programs like c sql plus or java which compiles a whole code and then runs it python will take an interpreter and read it line by line and run it line by line instead of making one executable and running the whole thing but actually it's a little more complicated than that python isn't just interpreted it's actually com has one compilation step into bytecode first and by code is just a low levels of instructions that can be read by the interpreter and it's a very quick compilation and it basically lets the interpreter read things a little quicker and those files end in pyc or dot pyo and don't worry that made no sense at all you don't need to know it it's just a cool fact that i think it's good to bring up an interview to show that you understand the language beyond just knowing how to use it and python files have a dot qi extension so what is python again it's an object-oriented language as well so object oriented you probably hear this a lot essentially it's a programming paradigm center on the idea of using objects seems pretty self-explanatory but objects essentially abstract away complex problems so instead of writing a list every single time you can use the list object to make your life simpler essentially they abstract away the problem so you have a higher level understanding of the code instead of using traditional lines of code and data we can just use objects instead finally we have a high-level programming language so essentially a high-level programming language has strong abstraction of the lower level aspect of the computer so essentially what that means is instead of making you write in zeros and ones or like in c making you allocate memory and do really nitty gritty things like that it'll handle water for you at the cost of hiding more things from you so you lose a little bit of control but you have a much smoother experience and it's great especially for new programmers so what is pythonic code so i'm going to touch this very very quickly samuel go over it more later but pythonic code is simply a design choice to produce highly readable python code so python veterans will usually write in pythonic style instead of writing code that's very c-style or java style in python so note poorly styled code can still do all the things that beautiful pythonic code can but codemains is essential for real developers and you guys are all going to be real developers eventually so you should focus on writing more readable code and pythonic code is really the epitome of that dynamic semantics is a great point it's just a very essentially it's a nitty-gritty of how typing works and how uh it's read by interpreter that's not too important so finally a good rule of thumb which i think you guys should remember is if you can write less while maintaining readability in python do that again i'm not saying try to compress your entire program function into one line if it's super messy and doesn't make any sense but if you can make it shorter and easier to read definitely do that and chi floor pythonic is actually an official term that people use and here's some good examples i'm not going to get into it too much because samuel will cover it later super quick setup info so here's the links to the documentation to help you set up on different os's and it's just another article i found is pretty useful we're also you can also use an online editor like replit so for a lot of the code you see today if you have the lecture slides opened up you can just click on a link which i'll keep next to it and you can actually run the code that we're using today and it'll be really useful so let's do it our very first python program so let's say you read those articles i had in the previous slide recommended ids for python i'd say vs code i use vs code for everything so our very first python program so let's say we set up everything in the previous slide how do we check that everything is working well as with most languages we're going to create a hello world program and this is super easy way to check in the environment stuff correctly and we have all our packages installed it seems like it might be very like irrelevant but even for people who've been programmed for years and years i still do this when i'm starting a new language and i set it up i'm going to print hello world so i know that everything is in place so after we create our dot py file with the code we can run the script in bash by writing python and then filename dot py or python3 so that really depends on how you set up python i'm not going to get go into that too much but let's go to how we print stuff in python so when it prints up in python we just write print put a bracket and then we put whatever we want to print in there within speech marks so you've probably seen this a lot in other languages okay i'm just going to have vs code here so we have print hello world we have that file here let's open up our i term don't look at that so if i run this it does says hello world okay cool so we know they're officially set up and this is the first thing you guys should do when you're setting up python your machines for the rest selection i'm not going to use yes code i'm going to use reflect that way uh you guys can follow along too okay do we have any questions about anything i think that's pretty straightforward yep okay no questions so let's get into the first thing variables so quick recap of variables variables help us store stuff in our programs the reason i say stuff and not data is because we can store more than just data within variables so you can think of it as a box you keep things in numbers strings references to other variables data structures objects anything can be stored inside a variable you even have nothing inside a variable which i'll cover soon so variables in python are cool because you don't need to specify a type and this is known as dynamic typing different data types include integers floats strings booleans but when you declare these variables you don't have to specify the specific type you can just say x equals and put whatever you want python will figure it out for you this can be a gift and a curse as you will see shortly another important time i want to cover is the nun type so from w3 schools the exact definition i got was none is not the same as zero false or an empty string none is a data type of its own called a nun type and only none can be none so you can't important thing to understand is that none isn't a useless thing it's actually really useful books can use an empty placeholder because you can't manipulate the nun type so if you want to declare a variable but keep it empty have nothing in there the nun type is a perfect option because let's say you actually forget that there's nothing in there and you try to do something like you know you add three to the variable your code will crash because you can't do that with the nun type exactly none in python is like the null in java all right so we have this code here i'm not going to have replicas it's pretty basic but if we look at this we say x is 4 and we change the type x is a list now and we say x is a string now and we print x what do you guys think is going to happen what will be printed just drop a message in the chat i'm yeah i'm a chameleon yeah exactly the string so as we said before dynamic typing means you don't have to declare a type and also variables aren't restricted to a single type it'll automatically allocate space for whatever you need so now we have conditionals so famous if else so this is an incredibly powerful way to let you make decisions in your code so let's look at some operators that we have so we have a few basic ones we have equals equals and that's true if the values are the same not equals it's true values are not the same uh greater than or equal to less than or equal to greater than less than those are pretty self-explanatory i think we have two new ones that which pretty good need to pipe on we have is an n so is text if you're referencing the same object so you could say something like if we say x equals three and then go if x is three it'll return true we can also do this if we say x equals a for example let's say we have two variables x and a say x equals a and do x is a that would return true because we're referencing the same object so this is better if you're trying to reference whole objects not specific values then we have n and it's pretty self-explanatory it checks if a value or an object can be found within another object so any questions about those okay cool all right so let's look at this code here you can run it by clicking on the link here it'll open up replit which you can use what do you guys think is going to happen with this code take a look at it drop a message in the chat and then i'll run it so i run it so let's try the else case let's say five we put five it says we have just five instead okay yeah input let me explain that line very quickly someone asked what is input well input as you can see when i run the code it'll prompt me for whatever the message says and then whatever i type in here will be stored into x so if i put two x will now be two i hit enter it'll say we have two instead so someone said if we enter 196 it'll print the favorite thing so let's let's see if that happens 196. wait it didn't say we have my favorite number just says we have 196 instead that's weird well some of the more eagle-eyed people here have noticed that it says conditional date up here why did that happen let's go into full screen well dynamic typing can be a gift and also a curse unfortunately what happened is when we took the input it takes input as a string it can be because we could have put abcd in here or any other string so even though we put only numbers or integers in those are actually a string character so what we actually have to do is that we have to cast the input string to an end so casting essentially means taking whatever we took the initial data type and changing this data type to something that we can use so casting is a pretty common suggestion that you use in many languages so let's run this code now yep sorry if you guys got baited it's a super common mistake the reason i put it in there because i when i wrote the code the first time actually had that bug and i think it's a good example of that so now if we put 196 we have my favorite number so while wrestling just says can we do int input yup you totally can do that the reason i put it separately was just explicitly show the dangers of dynamic typing and why we have to be careful about it so yeah that's a great point and this is great this works so we're really happy because we were able to use conditionals and we were able to handle dynamic typing so what if we have more than two conditions so i'm sure in java or c you just do if else and then within the else condition do you if else some other condition and you do if else some other other condition no this isn't very pythonic it's kind of messy and it's really open easy for you to have like logical errors using this method well it's more commonly used and python what i'd say you have to use especially for this class is the lf statement elif is a short for else if so you if some statement if that statement is false we'll do else if some other statement else is some other statement and you can keep having those and it's very very clear what the intended purpose of this string or this set of logical operators wants us to do and finally we hit the l so if all these other statements are false we use the else statement instead so there's no if necessary statements so faculty are asked are there no necessities statements that's a really good question we can use that for statements again bad code or badly style code will still do what we want but we'd rather use this because it's much clearer than a nested if statement it'll still work yep duty says exactly nested if statements not epic does equals equals not work for strings i believe this should work for strings but i can double check that yeah i'm pretty sure it does okay so let's look at this big chunk of code we got here so it's very similar to before but let's say if it's 196 we say it's my favorite number alif so if this is not true we run we check if this is true if it's a multiple of five so this operator here percentage sign is just modulus what modulus means is if we divide x by 5 what is the remainder um i'm sure you're familiar with that and finally that is also not true we just print we just have blank instead so as a sanity check let's see if we put 186 what happens we have my favorite number but if you put 195 it says 195 is multiple of five because we failed this this case here or this um logical statement here but this one was true so else if we go into there so any questions for that what if you put a string that asks you for a number well if you try to cast a string it'll just crash so let me put rohan here it'll crash because we can't cast a string into base 10. some other languages will actually let you cast that because each character is technically an ascii number which can then be casted into a integer but c python sorry will not let you do that c will let you do that yeah so that's a good question someone asked you not any parenthesis after if and left no you don't need parentheses so that's all something's pretty python and you can put parentheses here if you want for clarity but you don't need your python's pretty smart understand you put a colon here and understands that's the end of the logical operator so normally in pythonic code you don't put the parentheses because it's just extra noise that's not necessary someone asked if we have 195 that started would it print both another great question unfortunately no won't print both because if it hits the first statement it'll just do that because this is else if so else means if this is false and this is true it requires on both those conditions not just one so yeah good questions guys conditional is continued unless you want to have multiple conditions the same conditional statement you can use the and or the or keyword so you can do like if x and this is true or if you use or instead so to for someone who said you want the same thing on one line we can do this instead we could do if x equals equals 196 or an or is a keyword it'll get highlighted or mod5 equals equals zero we print my favorite number so let's run this 195 hit enter we have my favorite number okay moving on any questions before we get into the hoop how do you print a new line in python so the new line character in python is backslash n that's pretty common so if you want to print just a new line you do print backslash n like this but something to note is if you print in python it automatically adds a new line character at the end there so notice how um if i print two things here hi and then print 196 they won't continue on the same line they'll both start a new line because the way the print statement works in python is that it adds a new line character to the end of whatever string you're trying to print linker kind of asks why did one under 186 not work at first it didn't enter first because we inputted a string so when we inputted a string a string is not equivalent to the 196 number 196 in brackets or sorry in speech marks like this is different to 196 as a value like this how does python know in loops end so python knows when your loop ends because of the white space here you need to have white space in python that's actually a good point there normally when you're using your favorite ide if you just hit enter from an if statement it'll automatically tab you four spaces so you need to have that white space in python actually let me zoom out a bit that's clearer um whereas in java you might have like uh parentheses like this python doesn't use that python instead uses white space to indicate that you're within another layer of like an if statement or like a for loop great question what other questions do we have matt zombie that's a good question so we asked in your conditional with x or y if this is true will it evaluate y nope if this is true it's going to go right the condition it won't even check this so you can put like garbage here like doing weird stuff with none or something that'll break your coat and it won't get hit as long as this is true um other questions let me quick skim okay cool i think we're all good there let's go into the kahoot if you haven't joined already here's the code i'm gonna start the kahoot in about one minute i'm gonna paste the code here too and if you have any questions i will answer them later too all right i think we have everyone i'm gonna give it 30 more seconds that we're going to join so oh also i'm going to note that if you're top five in the kahoot you'll get extra credit just for fun because there's a lot of important stuff and if you've been listening then i think you should be rewarded for that most your projects will be in python or typescript anyway okay i'll help you out oh hey is five what's your net id okay it says you're not in here so all right i'm gonna start in one second we're starting true or false is python a compiled only language that's pretty quick guys good job that's the first question yep is python a compiled only language can we have the music let me know if you can hear it can you hear that sad yeah i don't think i have my audio recording on 40 seconds if nobody answers the next 10 i'm gonna skip somebody answered i think that's everybody that's good yup all right unless you got it right false so python isn't a compile only language python is officially it's an interpreted language if you want to get really nitty-gritty there's one compilation step where it goes from your python code to bytecode and then that's interpreted but most people just say python is an interpreted language good job guys unless you got it right there's the scoreboard true false write pythonic code less code is usually better good job moisturizer that's super quickly i'm gonna give like another 20 seconds for people with like latency issues just for an interest of time we'll just be on the midterm this class has no midterms so don't worry about that five more seconds and i'm going to skip all right again most you guys got this right yep pythonic code a good rule of thumb is less code is usually better as long as you're maintaining readability no quizzes no final so you're totally fine leaderboard again next question what would this chunk of code do some people just guess the answer to so don't worry if you're not getting super quick there's four choices because there's four options this one's a little tricky so uh think about it i'm gonna give it 20 more seconds 15 more seconds actually okay so a little mix here that's totally fine this was kind of tricky so this is actually going to fail on line two because if you have the nun type and you try to manipulate it it'll crash you can't do anything untyped you can't you can print it out but you can't do stuff like adding to it dividing it etc etc none is not it's no you try to mess with null your code's gonna crash so good job leaderboard good job first place maintain your spot what will be printed at the end of this code snippet here's another photo again this isn't super obvious so read it carefully you're on question four because this is question four tim's how all right so emily cross how is the nun type of placeholder if you can't manipulate it well it's a placeholder because let's say you just want to define a variable x but you don't have anything in it at the moment you put none in it because that way if you forget about and you try to manipulate x it'll crash and you know it's a reminder to you that you put none and that you wanted to put something real inside it later so it's just a placeholder because it can let you define a variable because you can't just declare a variable with nothing in it in python so you just define an empty variable essentially or if you want to clear a variable you can put that instead uh quickplan i don't know how you're on question five i'm sorry all right four seconds we have latency issues so i understand why it's taking a little longer five four three two one okay oh great i thought you guys would trip up more here but you guys are clearly smarter than i thought so great job uh so the reason is case two is because if you go to the first line here this is false because x mod 3 is not zero this is not divisible by three so you won't go here but here x not seven two hundred mod seven will give you a number that's not zero because two hundred isn't divisible by 7. and because it's not 0 it's evaluated as true anything not 0 is true in most programming languages to be honest so this will be true you'll print case 2 and you'll never reach these lower lines here yeah a little tricky which i remember is this won't give you true or false this will return a value and the value returned wasn't zero and because it wasn't zero it's evaluated as true yup sorry if that was a little tricky uh but you guys are good job unless you guys got that right so excellent work so back to the lecture for the next half of content and this is where stuff gets a little harder with python at least so loops so if you don't know what a loop is a loop allows us to repeatedly run the same section of code oh wait only 10 people got it right oh rough i thought most you got it right that's my bad my bad yeah good job the 10 people got it right thrust you i am sorry uh so we're going to cover for loops and while loops and python those with main loops i think it's only loops actually so here is the general pseudo code for how we do for loops in python so i want to emphasize something it's very different to what you normally see in java so in java you write you declare a variable like int i while i is less than something you do i plus plus so here this range function handles all that for you so you say for i or some variable in a range you do stuff so it just claims code so if we do 4i in range 10. essentially what this is saying is we're declaring a variable i for int i equals zero while i is less than 10 it defaults to i plus plus so we default at zero if we don't specify the first number and we go up to 10 but not including 10. so think of it as anti equal 0 i is less than 10 i plus plus that's the case in your for loop and we'll just print i and again we could follow all these code samples here and thankfully they're all on one big one here so we can just comment the rest of these out and if we run this it's just gonna go from zero to nine as expected so next another way we can do this any questions oh the shortcut for commenting is command or control forward slash that's super useful uh highly recommend using that instead of just typing a hash key so here we specify the start value and the end value the start value is inclusive and the end value is exclusive what i mean by that is if we put 2 here we'll print 2 and we'll go up to 10 but we won't print 10. we'll print 9 instead so let's run this it's gonna go two to nine instead this is the code sample that we just saw previously as you can see two to nine as expected makes sense right all right cool here i'm just gonna do something real quick okay so now something really important is and very pythonic is we don't need to specify uh the step inside the loop here we don't have to do i plus equals two or something weird like that what we can do is if we have a third optional parameter we can specify this step so what this is going to do is starting from 2 is going to keep adding 2 to i up until we reach 10 excluding 10. so what this does is it'll go from 2 to 9 adding 2 but 9 won't be included because when we hit 8 and we add 2 to 10 we'll be out of the range so that's a little complicated if we hit 8 and we add 2 we're at 10 which is outside the range that we specified here so we break out of the loop so someone said why does it print so for i in range two to ten why does it print from two to ten instead of three that's just the way python works it's inclusive of the start exclusive at the top end and i'm sorry that's confusing that's how the language works okay a cool thing with this as well is that if you use a negative number um we can iterate backwards to a list if this first number's uh bigger than the second number here if we do it backwards but this is let's put minus one here but this is smaller this is bigger we'll go into a forever loop because we'll never reach that top number so if you see that in the code this is what we just saw down here when i run it we go 2 4 6 8 we won't reach 9 or 10 because that's already outside the range okay enter inside the range no you don't need to have integers inside the range okay so now another way you can do this is you can do n so someone asked can you give an example of n well we have it right here so this is pseudo code again so we can say for a variable name in a data structure we do stuff so this is a list in python we will cover that very very shortly so don't worry if that is new essentially it's very similar to an array but it's definitely not an array not an array list is not an array uh so for value in x print the value so no words for explaining what this does is that essentially what it'll do is it'll just print every single value in x 196 like that this is a very pythonic way of doing it because uh it's two lines of code and it's very very clear what's happening here but if you want to see a c style version of this or a java style version you could do it like this for iron range length of x print each uh individual element within there and that'll do the exact same thing here oh i should commented this out my bad it'll do the exact same thing put 186. all right so it's pretty basic so now we have a while loop so while loop is very similar to java or c this is pseudo code so while some statement is true we run the code and ignore the is being highlighted there that's just um the id being weird so for example sorry about that let's say x is hundred while x is greater than 50 print x and then we decrement x by one so minus equals one what's cool about this is it's a it's operating for any normal operator so you could do plus equals multiplied equals divided by equals so this is essentially decrementing x by one each time and then printing it usually is is used more so i'm going to ask is it is used more than equals equals it really really depends i'd say to be safe use equals equals for the most part because that's evaluating values but if you have to evaluate objects use is so here we have an example code of that if statement here the while loop so if i run it we go from 100 all the way down to 51 but then once it equals 50 so it's no longer greater than 50 we don't we break out of the while loop but you got to be careful because if you don't change the condition or if the condition is always true or uh you aren't incrementing or decrementing the value of x so example while true it'll just run forever and you're going to crash your ide or whatever you're using now your id so you're going to crash your um bash or replay or whatever oh my bad x equals 50. this is never going to end because this condition will never change while true is always going to be true any questions about those loops how much card not so fast it's just when a command or control forward slash so i'm going to close this so we have break statements so notice how we were stuck in that loop forever we couldn't do anything once we're in that loop but what we can do is use a break keyword so if python reads this it'll break you out of the current loop so what do you guys think this is going to do take a guess gander what you think it's going to do and while you're thinking about it i am going to load up the code any guesses for what it's going to do so let's go through it line by line so four character in cs96 so one thing i want to note is that list strings in python are like lists you could treat like a list it's going to go through each character one at a time so if the character is a space a space is right there we print an empty line and we just break so i'm going to run we print this 96 and we break but notice something cool happened we didn't print each character on a new line that's because i replaced the new line character here with just uh empty sp like no space so this will replace it with whatever you want so i put like um an underscore here instead it will replace the new line character at the end of the print with underscore like that pretty cool right awesome okay workstation is super useful especially for those cases when you're within like a loop i do want to notice note though that if you're in a double for loop and you use break you'll only break out of the inner four loop or whichever loop called break it won't break you out of all the for loops so functions so sure functions aren't new to you but i'm going to go quickly a function is a block of code that we plan on reusing instead of writing the same code over and over again we can write a function instead and call the function instead so to clear a function python we follow this format so we'd use the keyword def give it a name and we put the arguments here so notice that in python you don't define a type for your function so you don't need to define return types or the types of your arguments dynamic typing will handle all that for you so here we have an example here example code here you can run it i'm not going to go through it because it's pretty self-explanatory and to save time but let's say we do death greet name time of day we put someone's name and then one of these letters it'll print hello or good morning and then that person's name and you could try that later this is a very basic way of very basic function we see here so to call a function we do function namely put all the arguments like so so for example we do greed rohan e and what that would do is it would say pass rohan here e here and say print good after uh good evening rohan easy so a function will return to the code that called it once the function is finished running so if you want to manually leave a function we use the return keyword so return will return to the code segment to call the function and if we write return and then a list of variables after it'll return those variables so let's look at that over here so notice this here right i'm actually going to run this because this is pretty useful so if we do define a function here if x is greater than zero return one if it's equal to zero return zero and if it's not return if it's less than zero return minus one so notice how we're returning something here if i run this we return those values and print those values one after the other so if you you could put a list of things here you could play multiple things and we print it it'll return a bunch of things and it isn't like constant or static and here's a cool example of getting two numbers back uh so you can go this code in your own time watch how we return two things back so it'll print two things try this out in your own time is return to python cylinder java yep very similar now we have lists so lists are collection which are ordered and changeable and duplicates are allowed so lists can remind you of arrays but they are not arrays the reason i like arrays is because arrays uh lists are resizable they essentially make your life a little easier and had a lot of the complexity there's more information about what a list exactly is in different kinds of collections on w3 schools if you're curious so in python the types of elements within the list don't need to be the same and we can use lists or multiple values using one variable so again all the code is here so let's open that up you define a list using just empty square brackets and you can put values in it like so so this is all strings but i could put numbers in here instead of just strings or anything that i want essentially and as an element we use the square brackets followed by the index that we want and remember that python index are zero indexed like that and this will print the zeroth index it'll print c and this will print the third index so zero one two three or print nine but if you do these lines here your code will crash so be careful if we get the length of a list sorry you write when x or whatever the variable is and we'll print the line so this will return one two three four five so i did speech text that's very similar what you see in java but i want to watch slicing now slicing is a very pythonic way of getting a range of values within a list so if you do two colon fiber something colon something you'll start at this first value here and go up until this last value so here if we go zero one two three four five so five we don't reach five we stop just half below before it but we'll get 196. so that i want to show you guys so look at the top thing here we get 196 like so and now notice that if we don't specify something after the cold or before the colon we go to the end or start of the list respectively so two to five here the same is going to be two colon nothing because that just specifies going all the way to the end and if you do zero to two it's equivalent to writing nothing to two because that means we're from the start of the list to the second now go out of bounds you won't go out of bounds and you specify nothing here because it'll just stop at the end and yes these are indexes here so these values here indexes the colon separates the starting index and the ending index so like in a lot of other languages lists in python are simple arrays of bytes and there's no so a string can be treated as a list essentially there's no single character date type like other languages a single character is just a list of length one so because of this fact we can treat strings like lists so for example if we do s and slice it from the second index to the end we go zero one two to the end it'll print 196. sunset with you minus three if you minus three it'll actually start from the end and go backwards it'll go zero one two three and then go forward like that here's a bunch of util list functions uh i'm not going to go through these in-depth because you're not going to be asked about these these are really useful what they want to talk about though is sort so sort here will sort your list using the time sort function so instead of writing your own bubble sort or something like that using the sort function that's built in is a really powerful tool could use the time sort algorithm it's very very fast and you switch your list very quickly so remember that because it's useful for like interview questions and stuff so looking at time i'm not sure if we can quickly go through exception handling uh but don't worry it's too much this is a little more advanced and sami will probably cover it again so when an exception or error occurs python will stop running and send us an error message it's not a graceful exit but if you use exception handling we can handle the exception without crashing the program so to do this we use the try except and then the finally commands so if an exception occurs in the try block python catches the exception and moves on to except block and runs the code in there so what would this code do so if i open this up while it's loading this goes to crash you can't concatenate a number to a string it's just gonna crash but here's what we can do instead let's say we do try x plus equals two if an exception happens within the try block here look at the pointer the try except happens here we'll hit the exception case here and then print we hid an exception instead that's exactly what happens so i can show that here let me comment this out if i run this instead of crashing it's going to handle the exception catch it and move us onto the accept statement is similar to java try catch very very similar yeah so the code in the final block we run regardless of whether an exception occurs or not and this is an optional step usually you won't use it you can just write try accept but it's useful if you're returning or exiting from the program essentially it'll just do whatever is happening finally before returning or exiting so for here example if there's an error here it'll print the error but before returning it'll do whatever function we have here so does that make sense that went pretty quickly okay i would talk about this very quickly because i think it's really cool and fun so when to use try accept over if else so if else always has a cost to that comparison however try except the other hand is very minimal cost if no exception occurs but if an exception does occur it's very expensive so this is known as branching and you'll cover that in 233 don't worry about it too much all you need to know is that if else we're always going to compare if and else but with tri-except we assume that try is almost always going to happen so we don't really uh give a lot of time to the except we just assume it's going to be try but if an exception happens it's very expensive to like account for that risk so therefore use try except exceptions are rare like less than temperatures of time otherwise you can use stick to else so i want to show you that here and the stack overflow article here explains it really well but you can run this code here what what it does is it runs like a 10 million whatever number that is iterations using if else and then same code try accept and while this is running in the background i will answer any questions you guys have so any questions about some stuff we covered right now they've made money on the program nope it's computational time so any questions about try accept or list because we went to that kind of quick can you another try accept and explain it yeah for sure so if we look at this code here right let's do something we can't do that example with the none so let's say x equals none uh try x plus equals three except prince uh none hit like this so oh sorry i'm trying to zoom out if uh x is none and we try to add something to it normally the code will crash but if you have something in the try block python is like okay this could potentially crash so i'm going to make sure to catch any exceptions the exception that happens here i know that it's going to happen so i catch it and i move into here instead the code will continue to run none hit and then i can run more code here and that'll work okay any other questions about what you guys saw today regarding lists or error handling anything else rewriting python what's the finally thing so finally with try except basically what finally does is this is still loading for some reason i'm not sure why what finally does is regardless of whether try happens or accept happens finally we'll be wrong afterwards so if in one of these cases you return so let's see this exception and you want to return like leave the function you can still run some code in the file block before you return is what it's saying uh don't worry about the kahoot if you're if you answer a question you'll be fine why not put the code outside the finally so duty of your question i thought i also thought it was kind of useless to have this here but actually let's say i put the return here and there's no uh finally finally tag here you'll just return you won't run any more code what finally lets you do is finish and do some cleanup before you return and leave the function lists are filled using square brackets and arrays are zero yep is there a big difference in big orientation for trying if they go notation no but if you're looking at actual to speed and like the way the low level stuff works yes and i'm trying to run this for you guys but it's not opening up for some reason if it doesn't open up i'll run on vs code we're going to run our vs code so we have the speed test here so it's going to take a couple seconds uh because it's a very very big number that we're trying to do that's the code and we're going to do this many iterations a lot of iterations but notice how much quicker so it took 14 seconds for if else and only 7 seconds for try except yeah python's relatively slow language because uh it's written in c and everything is uh nothing too much uh in depth but essentially everything is malik like a lot of memories handled slowly because you don't control it yourself it's handled by the interpreter and the compiler so it's pretty slow in that regard any other questions guys also if you were here
and the way that you find the length of a list is by wrapping it in this len function and this handles all of the incrementing for you it handles all of the bounds of the loop for you um and then there's also the for each loop in python for each loop all we have to say is for the elements in the data structure that you're looking for so in this case for instructor and instructors you will be able to have access to the values of every single element in the list and so the first one up here would print exactly what the second one prints out but the first one is an index for loop the second one is a for each loop and finally we have another traditional loop a while loop very standard just like any other programming language however again the main distinction is that indentation actually matters in python rather than what you see in languages like java so functions a bit different as well as we saw with variables you don't have to specify types it's the same thing with functions so here we don't have to specify what type this function returns we just have to declare a function by using this def keyword with the function name and then the parameters same thing with the types and then just like usual the return statement is the return keyword very very standard stuff and nothing too crazy uh we talked about the list data structure so we talked about how python uses lists and so a very big thing that we want to touch on again is that lists are lists they are not arrays and what that means is that you know you're probably used to arrays and so uh arrays are fixed size you can't really you know add things if it's beyond the you know size of the array so lists are much more flexible than arrays they're a lot easier to work with and they're a lot easier to use so these are some of the useful list functions we talked about so if you want to add something to the end of the list you use the append keyword the append function you just you put in the parameter that you want to add uh if you want to insert something at a certain location on a list you just specify what location you want to insert the elements in so in this case if you want to insert at element at index zero you can just specify that with the insert function uh these lists have many different functions including things like sort etc so lists in python are very useful data structures that you'll use quite a bit and someone asks so are lists like arraylists in java yes they are the list data structure rather than the array data structure so for those of you who are in cs125 right now that might be new to programming you will learn how to use and implement a list in java later in the semester but for those of you are already familiar with lists in java yes this is very similar to the array list in java so let's go ahead and get to the main content for today uh that quick review is hopefully things that you should already know by now uh rohan went over it very nicely on tuesday and we've had a bit of practice with it in the homeworks if you've started that already so today we're going to talk about first what is pythonic code and so pythonic code is something that we want to touch on because it's really why you want to use python over you know a language another higher level language so pythonic code means that when you're writing code in python if it's pythonic it's not just correct code it's not just code that compiles it's not just code that is technically syntactically correct but it's also code that is writing python in the way that python is intended to be used and so what does this mean what is a good example of that well in other words python is a really really beautiful language i know it's kind of weird to call a programming language beautiful it sounds like i'm a nerd for saying it but once you get more experience writing python you will see exactly what i mean python is a beautiful language and it can allow you to write super clean elegant beautiful code in ways that you can't really see in other programming languages and so this is what it means to be pythonic and so we'll have some examples here so uh stop simping over python show us what you mean this is probably what you're thinking and i will do exactly that i will show you some examples so let's see some examples so let's say i want to find if an element exists in an array if something is inside of an array if i have an array of numbers and i want to see for example if 5 is in that array so let's see what this would look like in java for example so in this case we don't have numbers let's say we have an array of fruits and i want to see if this cherry string is inside of this list of fruits so that's what we have right here and let's say i want to update this boolean flag found if i find it in the list and so what we would do is we would have a for loop we would loop through the length of the array and once we find an element that is equal to cherries then we'll change found to true otherwise it will stay false now this isn't terrible i mean this is completely fine if you were in java like this is how you would write the function very likely but in python we can do this very beautifully but first let's see what it would look like if we directly translate it to python and this is something that i want you guys to kind of try to sway away from try to sway away from writing java code in python because there's a lot of the time a usually better way to write it in python it's usually there's usually a pythonic way of writing it so here is what a direct translation from java to python would look like you would just translate all these lists and then loop through once you've found cherries found is equal to true so this is what it looks like um but what does this look like pythonically how can we do better how can we use python in the way that it is intended to use so here is the code um let's say we have our list of fruits apples oranges bananas etc what we can do is just simply say cherries in fruits which which will return a boolean value of whether or not cherries was found in fruits and so this is a good example of what it means to be pythonic this is not really something that you'll find in many other programming languages this is a very python specific feature but it allows you to write very nice beautiful elegant code and so i could run this code for you but i think it's fairly self-explanatory it'll just basically update found to true if it found it and false if it didn't in this case found will be false because cherries is not in fruits not in this array at least so this kind of idea allows us to enable it enables us to write very readable beautiful code that reads just like english so here's an example of how we can utilize this idea of if something is in another language so let's see let's see if we can solve the question of if a hot dog is a sandwich so this is a very controversial idea and there's a source that i've been sent called cuberule. com that says that a hot dog is not a sandwich but let's see let's see how we can write this in python we can we can have a list of sandwiches according to what cube rule says and so we can say if hotdog in sandwiches rather than what we saw in java where we would have to loop through and actually say well if hotdog is at one point in this array return true we can actually in python just say if hot dog in sandwiches return yes a hot dog is a sandwich otherwise according to a cube rule it is a taco so this i can run this code but it will just print out according to cube rule as it is a taco if you are very passionate about this idea of uh you know if a hot dog is a sandwich or not there there is a link right here that you can read about uh i'm not very passionate about the idea i've gone down that rabbit hole way too many times but if you're interested there it is for you so let's go through some more examples of what it means to be pythonic and how to write pythonic code so first we already saw the in keyword let's see some more things so let's say i want to sum all of the numbers from 10 to a thousand so like we said in java you would just simply say let's have our starting number our ending number and then a a variable that will store the total sum of the values in between 10 to a thousand and we'll just basically sum up all of those numbers and if we want that that value we can just print out total sum or return it in a function so this isn't terrible right i mean this looks fine but how can we do better if we wanted to write this in python is this what we should do should we just translate our java code over to python well in this case we shouldn't we should actually utilize the features that are in python we can write this much more pythonically so what does this look like pythonically well in python we have uh you've already seen the range function this is the range function that you would see in a for loop where you say like four i in range of you know some range so the range function will give us the numbers from ten to a thousand uh with in this case a thousand and one because this is the upper bound uh not inclusive and so if you want to sum up the numbers from ten to a thousand and one non-inclusive uh we just wrap it in a sum function and this will give us the total sum and so this is so much nicer to read in terms of english in terms of elegance this is what it means to be pythonic and this is the kind of code that we encourage you to write when you are writing python uh and i can execute this uh here if you would like you can the slides are available you will see that this will return the same thing that this would return so here's some tips for writing pythonic code um pythonic code isn't something that you'll be able to write from the first day that you learn python because there's a lot of ways to be pythonic and so um here's my little tip for how to write pythonic code it's something that takes time and so if there's something that sounds like you might need to lift your finger up just a little bit too far uh if there's something that that sounds just too much for your python royalty and you just cannot be bothered then just simply google what you want and then you will likely see you know a pythonic way to do what you want and over time as you do this more and more you'll find a lot of ways to become pythonic a lot of different tools and techniques to do this so for example if i wanted to find a way to reverse a list and so in java i'm sure all of you can imagine a way to reverse a list you would have to you know loop through things stored in a new list etc uh but in python you would just simply google it first if you don't know how to and you would find something like this you would see that there is a very very pythonic way of doing it using slicing slicing is a concept that rohan taught in the first lecture you can you know simply with just one line of code that is very readable very understandable reverse your list that originally looked like this into something like this so there's a lot of different ways to be pythonic and it'll take time but this is how i recommend you go about becoming more pythonic and in this lecture we will go through a couple concepts that will allow you to be pythonic in your own code let me go ahead and see if we have any questions so some people are asking if i'm throwing shade on java but not telling us the sum function well you see the point is uh it's not that java doesn't have a sum function or something it's just the combination of python features right uh as far as i know java doesn't have a range function unless i'm missing something or i haven't in java code in a while um but it's just python code is just the idea that python has a lot of unique features and so using them in this kind of fashion to write cleaner more elegant code more readable code it's something that you can't really see in many other languages um is there a reverse function um i believe there is a reverse function but i'm giving you very simple examples there are many more examples that we will go through today um so i believe we have a kahoot question or no okay we will start off by talking about list comprehensions and then after that we'll go ahead and start off with a couple kahoot questions so here's a concept called list comprehensions this is one way of being pythonic in your own code so list comprehensions are a classic pythonic tool it allows you to create new lists from other lists and it is basically reading like english so let me show you exactly what i mean by first demonstrating you know the functionality of what you would get out of a list comprehension without a list comprehension so here is what would it look like if we wanted to square every element in a list without having list comprehensions which i haven't showed you yet but just keep this idea in mind first i want to show you what it would look like to square every element in a list and store it in a new list so first i would have this list of numbers so 3 4 6 12 16 and 25 and if i wanted to store all of the squares into this new list i would loop through all of the numbers in my numbers list and i would append the square of them in the squares list and i would print out squares at the end so you know this is without a list comprehension this is a very non-pythonic way of doing this this is something that you could basically write in any programming language however let's make this pythonic so how can we do the same thing that we did in that code example that i have down here but in a pythonic way uh someone's asking what is append this is something that was covered in the first lecture append is how you add something to the end of a list um so here is our example of list comprehensions up here so let's say i have this list the same list that we saw in the example down here and i want to have the same kind of behavior but i want to be more pythonic more readable what we can do is this idea of list comprehensions and so here how this reads is we will be outputting the square for every single number in the numbers array and so what squares will print out here i could run it if you would like it will print out the squares of all of those numbers so let me see if i can actually get this code snippet running for you let's see so if i just execute this you will see that we have all of the squares of the numbers that we have here in this new list that we generated using this list comprehension so let's go ahead and get back into the slideshow so how can you actually write a list comprehension yourself here is the general structure of a list comprehension demonstrated very nicely down here so first things first you want to have your output expression so in this case we want to square the numbers in the list so our output what will be going into the new list is this right here the number squared then we will have our um in this case like a for loop so we all know how to do a for loop you know 4e in our list or whatever thing that you can iterate over so that's this right here and at the end here we have an optional predicate or an optional conditional which we will talk about in a little bit but this part is optional and so that's why you don't see it in this list comprehension example and so this is a very nice way of being pythonic to generate lists in python let's see some more examples so here is how we can supercharge our list comprehensions using conditional logic so let's say i want to output all of the vowels in order in this list i can go ahead and say this is our output the vowel and so i want to loop through the sentence so for vowel in sentence if the vowel is in this string so if i find a character in this string that is also in this string right here then we can go ahead and add them to our output list which will be the vowels array or sorry list someone is asking do the outputs for list comprehension have to be stored in a list as far as i know yes they they are list comprehensions uh so let me go ahead and show you guys what this code outputs um in a compiler so that way you can get a better idea so here we have all of the vowels that we saw so if you're you know generating a new list based on the string right here we would see that e is a vowel o is a vowel e is a vowel a is a vowel and so on and so forth and put this in the output list so we can go and show off another list comprehension here following the general structure someone asked why don't you need the um star star 2 for this one well the star star i'm not sure if rohan would cover this in the first lecture but the star star is how you square something in python so if i wanted to for example subtract 2 from every element in this list i would just simply say n minus 2 here the star star is not specific to list comprehensions it is specific to how you square things in python so this is our output expression that's all it is and so i hope this example in particular demonstrates how nicely readable these list comprehensions are this essentially reads just like english so let's go ahead and go through another example so we can have multiple loops as well so let's say i want to find the common numbers between list a and list b let's say i want to find the numbers that both of these share so i can just go ahead and say let's have two loops let's loop through all the numbers in list a and while i'm doing that let's go through all the numbers in list b and if the number in list a is equal to the number in list b then let's put that in our output expression which will go into our output list our common num and so we'll see that all of the output numbers uh all the common numbers that they share will go into the output list so these are 2 3 and 4 because they appear they occur in both lists so i hope all these examples kind of give you an idea of how to put this structure into action someone asked in the discord chat is there any syntax for list comprehension yes just follow this general structure down here you want to have your output expression just like we have here you want to have your loop or multiple loops and then you can have your optional predicate just like you see up here following this general structure it can help you write list comprehensions yourself so someone said on the twitch chat i feel like this can get very convoluted really quickly if you have like five loops going on this is completely correct and this is actually something that i was going to talk about but i might as well talk about it now so as you can tell i mean this as is is approaching convoluted so the whole point of using list comprehensions is to be elegant and to be readable in a way that sounds like english but the moment that you guys get a little bit carried away with these list comprehensions try to not do that if there's something that's better off written not as a list comprehension uh you know in this way just stray away from it because you want to write readable code but you don't want to write convoluted code just for the sake of using these features but you know for example something like this i mean this is a very elegant way of doing it and this is how you want to how you would want to write um you know squaring every element in a list in python same thing here this is totally fine and i would say this is totally fine as well but have a limit to how convoluted that you get don't go too far otherwise you know these list comprehensions can get very complex um so let's go and have a couple kahoot questions i'll show you guys the code right here and give you guys a couple minutes to join in and feel free to ask any questions in the meantime [Music] so [Music] someone asked me how am i celebrating today i'm celebrating by giving and preparing this lecture for you guys you accidentally capitalized the first letter of your netid is that okay you know i'm actually not sure if that's okay i think it's okay um i i'm pretty sure the way that we process the data we make sure that casing is fine [Music] so are there points for attendance yes uh this is your points for attendance i have a kahoot joining the kahoot [Music] um i am hella sleepy it's like 5 a. m can i dip yes you can dip uh this is something we talked about in the first lecture we have we have the recordings of these up right after the lecture and to get credit you just do the questions on prairie learn and you will get your attendance credit uh can you check your overall grade yet we are working on putting up a grade book but for the most part i mean all the grades are up on prairieland for the homework assignments so uh someone said the prairieland attendance didn't come for the last time i believe it did but you might have missed the deadline because we only have the prairieland attendances up until the next lecture so it comes out pretty quick and then it expires like for in this case like 30 minutes ago [Music] uh so i believe it was there you should have seen it uh we just don't want to give you guys too much time on those because then you'll fall behind in lectures okay i'm gonna go and get the kahoot started we have two questions um so to start how can we check if an element exists in a list named names pythonically this should be very self-explanatory the coot today should be very easy just to make sure that you guys are following along if we do the kahoot do we need to do the attendance questions on prairie learn this is like the age-old question in this course that we've been asked i think maybe like 70 times now it's on the syllabus and we've said it so many times if you did the kahoot you don't need to do the attendance questions on prairie learn the attendance questions on prairie learn are for the people that don't watch it live there you go that's the answer if i have to answer it again i'm gonna cry uh [Music] happy birthday thank you guys thank you guys okay well done to the 87 of you uh so it seems like we have some people confused about this other trick question uh while python does read like english it's not this much like english there is no such thing as is in its only if elements in the iterable such as a list so well done let's do one more question uh so what is the list comprehension for multiplying all elements in a list called nums by two so uh this is going to be similar to what i showed you guys on the slides uh someone said is in is a valid thing in python no is is a valid keyword and in is a valid keyword but is in together like to accomplish what we had in that last question is not a thing um is is a thing in is a thing but is in is not a thing okay uh well done to the 83 of you so we have some confusion with blue and yellow so for blue uh this would be correct if it was not in the wrong structure so if you guys remember uh this is the general structure where you want your output expression to the to the furthest to the left so here our output expression is all the way on the right this is not okay this is not how it how list comprehensions will work down here no one chose that thank god but down here a little bit confusing with the star star so the star star is what i showed you guys on the slides that was to square a number but this question was asking for multiplying which is just nums times two okay doesn't look like we have any more questions people are talking about how is in is valid in pandas we're just talking about native python here guys native python keywords so we can talk about more libraries later on um so let's continue so another pythonic tool which is enumerate and so what enumerate allows us to do is basically sometimes we want to assign an index to values in a list and so this is what enumerate allows us to do so let's say we have a list that has let's say values such as cars we have kia audi and bmw so let's say you know i want to have access to the indices and i want to assign every single one of these values and index we can use enumerate and so what this looks like would be you know 0 0 kia one audi and two bmw so let's go and take a look at this so a common use case for this is in the context of for loops so rather than you know what we showed off earlier with indexed for loops by saying for i in range of a list you can actually um in this case say for i comma the value in enumerate and then the list that you're trying to iterate over so here what this will give us is for each value in this list we will assign it an index we will assign it a value so if we were to print out this statement right here we would get zero pizza one kimchi to ramen etc is enumerate a function yes it is and that's actually something that we will talk about in this next slide um yes so no more questions about that so yes so enumerate is very useful with loops but it doesn't always have to be in the context of a loop so here if i just wanted to you know pair an index with every value of a list this is pythonic because if you would imagine doing it not pythonically you would have like a for loop where you loop through all the values and have like an index counter and just basically pair them together that way but in python enumerate does this for you and so if you don't want to do it in the context of a list in a context in the context of a loop you can actually just use it just like this enumerate foods enumerate returns what is called an enumerate object so if you want to display it nicely you would just want to wrap it in a list just like this a list type cast it to a list and you would get an output just like this so i can show you guys what this looks like in the compiler uh so first if i just comments out this thing on the bottom here and just execute this so as you can see um we can just have 4i comma food and enumerate foods so i will pair with the the left side of enumerate which is the index and food will pair with the right side of enumerate which is the food and so when we're printing it we can just say print i comma food and we'll get something just like this and so someone asks a question about this one down here this is showing off how enumerate doesn't always have to be in a loop we can use it just as a [Music] as a function and so you'll see the output right here so people are asking are those tuples in a list yes these right here with the parentheses are the tuple data structure and we have tuples in our homework so the parentheses are the tuple data structure i don't believe we've actually covered it but tuples are very similar to lists except they are not mutable and uh other than that i mean they use parentheses instead of brackets and those are the main distinctions between the two and so enumerate returns tuples uh and so when we cast them into a list we'll get a a list of them so that is what enumerate is i hope that makes sense doesn't look like we have too many questions about it uh someone asked if you pre if you typed print enumerate would that work no it wouldn't it would give us um my parentheses are off here yeah let's do this yeah so just give us this enumerate object at this memory address that's why you want to cast it to a list technically it compiles and everything but uh this is not really useful to print out and someone asked do you need to use enumerate as a looped to work no um that that's what this is showing off right here okay why are the parentheses in the output when you loop is because those are tuples which i don't think we had time to cover up in the first lecture but as i said tuples are just basically like lists except they are not mutable and they use parentheses instead of brackets so those are the main distinctions enumerate uses tuples and i believe you will have some practice with tuples on the homework that we have released so that is enumerate people are asking uh won't lists already have indexes yes lists will have indexes but or indices but this is how you would do it pythonically with the enumerate function and you can pair them together very nicely at the same exact time so i hope that clears up the questions about enumerate um so that wraps up a lot of the part of the lecture that we're talking about pythonic tools so there are many ways to be pythonic like i said earlier with more experience in the language you will get better writing this elegant pythonic code but until then just try to sway away from writing java code and python try to use the features that python provides and if you don't know what those features are just kind of have the intuition the you know push to when there's something that seems like there would be something for that in python just look it up say you know how do i reverse a list in python pythonically and you will find the answer to your question and over time you will get something you will get a better intuition for writing pythonic code so now that we are done covering kind of what pythonic code is and how to write pythonic code let's learn some data structures but first we have a couple questions about the the enumerate someone asked why did the for loop print out a tuple and not the items in a tuple that's because the tuple kind of pairs together as those pairs together the index with the value rather than just print out the value itself so if you have a list of values enumerate will for each value pair it with an index basically and they're stored in those tuples for every single value okay and someone asked what objects are valid in print object a very large amount of them i can't tell you all of them but most of the time the print function in python is very nice and will be able to print out what you would like without having to do much casting so let's talk about our first data structure so i say data structure because many of you if you're especially if you're new to programming you only know the array data structure and now we've showed you the list data structure which is very commonly used in python uh we will show you some new data structures the first one being the set and so what a set is is it it is an unordered and unindexed data structure meaning that they don't have indices and they don't maintain the order of the things that you add to it and each value is unique so you won't have any duplicates when you store things in a set so another feature is that it is very fast when you use it as a lookup table this is something that we will talk about very briefly after some code examples however it does require some knowledge of things that aren't exactly taught yet you will learn it later in 125 and definitely in cs225 and also these sets have functions in what you would see in like a math set so you would have things like union intersection etc so let's go through an example of a set in python and we'll run through how to you know interact with a set while we do it so first things first the way that you initialize an empty set is with this right here you just say your variable is equal to set parentheses and so it's the same thing that you would have with like a list but in this case you have a set and so the way that you add values to a set is you just do dot add with the value that you would like to add very self-explanatory but like we said earlier sets do not have duplicates so here i've added one three four and five into the set but if i want to add three again into the set we won't have that in our output twice we will only have it once so let me go ahead and show you guys what that would look like right now so if i execute this and i print out what i've added into the list you'll see that three only shows up once because sets do not have duplicates we can also cast to sets so if i have a list here with duplicates i can cast it to a set and you will see that all of the duplicates are removed and it is now a set rather than a list um we mentioned that and the way that you cast it of course is by wrapping it with the type that you would like so in this case it's a set uh we said that these sets are not ordered and they are not indexed so the way that you would have to get values from the set if you wanted to is just by these normal for each loops so if i wanted to print out all of the numbers in this set i would just say four number in numset and here you will see that we have one three four and five um that is the original set of course and so uh another way to access elements is by saying uh if elements in the data structure just like we did with lists so if i want to check if four is in the set we can just say if for in numset and we will see that here 4 is indeed inside of the set because we've initialized it with that value or rather up here and another thing to mention is that lookups into sets so checking if something is in a set is much faster than lists and we will talk about why a little bit right after this and so also we have these math functions that i told you about so sets and math you can do like unions you can do intersections you can do uh you know many other things so in this case if i want to find like the union between odd and even we'll see that we can union these two sets together and we'll have you know the elements from both sets if i want to have prime intersect to the odd set i can just do primes dot intersection with odds and that'll give us that intersection and same thing with the prime and the evens so those are the basic functions that you'll see in a set and how to interact with one so let me go ahead and show you guys a common example actually first let me tell you guys why lookup times are faster in sets than arrays and lists so this is something you'll learn about more later on in 125 and for sure in cs225 but basically if you want to look at if something is in a list whether you're doing it or not under the hood what it is doing is looping through the list and saying is this element inside of this list so you look at every single element until you've found the element that you're looking for in data structures and lists that are very large that actually takes time like going through every single element so if there's something you know all the way in the middle of a list that is like 3 million elements large that takes quite a bit of time quite a bit of computational time so with sets i don't want to explain exactly why because that'll take too long and that is beyond the scope of this lecture but you don't have to do that it is just constant time you want to find something it'll tell you right away without having to do any iterating through the data structure so it's much faster in terms of lookups and so with that said let me show you guys a common use case of sets as a result of that functionality the being able to find things very fast uh inside of a inside of a data structure without having to actually loop through every single time whether you're doing it or whether it's happening under the hood so let's say i have a player a list of players strings nba players and let's say i want to welcome them but if i've already seen them if i've already welcomed them i want to just say hello again and so sets are very useful in this kind of algorithm you might use this algorithm in a you know coding interview type question if you want to keep track of things that you've seen already the set data structure is very useful so let's say i want to iterate through the players list and say if i've already seen the player so if player in scene then just say hello again to the player however if i haven't seen them add them to the scene list because now i've seen them and then say hello or rather welcome to the player and so if i execute this you can see what it looks like you'll see that for the second time that i find someone i will say hello again and this is very nice because if we actually stored what we've seen in a list it would take much longer than it would uh with a set because of the things that you'll learn later on in 225 that i don't want to cover but just keep in mind the iterating thing that i told you about so that is a common use case of sets let's go ahead and go through a couple quick kahoot questions we are running low on time but i should we should be able to get through everything so the question true or false sets hold duplicate elements it should be very self-explanatory and for the sake of time i will be cutting it off at 20 seconds someone said sets are just hash sets yes if you know what a hash set is um if not you'll learn it eventually set is basically a dictionary yes we will learn what dictionaries are right after this okay i'm going to go ahead and cut this off for the sake of time so sets hold duplicate elements this is false sets do not hold duplicate elements they only hold unique values uh next question we can access elements in sets by index true or false [Music] uh people are are saying that they disconnected from the kahoot that's fine as long as you answered some questions you should be good in terms of attendance just still follow along uh we might go a little over but not by too much i will try my best to keep this within 15 minutes okay i'm gonna actually just cut this off here most people have answered so for we cannot access elements and sets by index because they are unindexed sets elements and sets do not have indices so you cannot do that if you want to access elements inside of them you can either see if that element is in by saying the in keyword or you can loop through the values but you cannot access by index so next the dictionary so dictionaries are another data structure and so in lists we access elements by referencing indices but with dictionaries rather than referencing indices we reference keys they are key value pairs and i'll show you exactly what i mean by that in an example and they have the same exact qualities as a set in terms of fast lookup times so if you want to look up if a key is inside of a table it is very fast just like the set compared to a list so let's look at a quick example and i'll show you guys a common use case of dictionaries as well so this is the syntax for initializing a dictionary so here we have our key which is brand model and year and then our values which is going to be ford mustang and the number you can have mixed types in terms of what the values are storing and to initialize one you would use these curly braces with these colons separating the key and the value and so how you access values is first you can have either the square brackets there are two ways to access values so if i want to access brand i would just you know say card [ __ ] with the square brackets and then the name of the key because we access things in dictionaries by accessing them by key rather than index which is what you'd see in a list and so we can also do dot get with the same exact thing we can say dot get with the key name and so the difference between these two dot get and the square brackets is that if you reference an element that doesn't exist in the dictionary if you reference a key that doesn't exist dot get will return none while the square braces will return a key error and i'll show you exactly what i mean here so here ignore everything down on the bottom here i want you to direct your attention to none up here is me accessing the elements none is what happens when we do get but if i uncomment this and i access with the square brackets we will raise a key error so that is the difference between the two uh use whatever one makes sense at the time sometimes you do want that error and sometimes you want none so if you want to change values you can access them just like we did when we printed them out and just update them so let's say i want to update the values of the brand model and your keyword we can just update them like so and print it out if we would like so i can show you guys what that looks like so um you can see here that if i want to add something to the list just give it a key that it hasn't seen so in the original dictionary mechanics was not a key but if i want to add a value to it we can just refer to mechanics and then a list for example here of all of the mechanics that my car has seen and when we print that out you'll see here that we have the updated list so this is how we add values and this is how we change values if we want to loop through the keys we can just say four key in the dictionary that'll give us the key it doesn't matter what the name of the variable here is i just named it key for clarity if you want to loop through the values we just run dot values on the name of the dictionary and that'll give us all of the values so here you see all of the keys mechanics brand model and year down here you'll see all of the values that we've added to it which is the list of mechanics the model and the brand and the year if we want to loop through both we can just do dot items which will give us both the key and the value at the same exact time inside of those tuples that you saw with the enumerate so we went over that very quickly but i want to go over an example of how you can how you can use these uh dictionaries right after a quick kahoot question we will wrap up very soon sorry for going a bit over this is the final kahoot question so how can i get the value of the marks key in this dictionary that i have for you i went over this very quickly but this should be fairly self-explanatory as long as you are following along and i will also cut this off pretty quickly just like the other two so get your answers in as soon as you can we have one more example to go through and then we'll be done for the day you can select multiple uh answers here [Music] [Music] i'm evil i'm sorry i don't know like i'm the worst i don't know i'm sorry there's multiple answers to this question the cat's out of the bag [Music] um all right so well done to blue and yellow these are both valid ways of accessing the marks key uh two is wrong because as we said dictionaries don't have indices like like what you see in lists they have keys you access by key not by index and so here we said dot get and square brackets are both completely fine except square brackets if you access an element that is not in the dictionary a key that doesn't exist it will raise a key error while dot git will give you the value none so that is it for the kahoot and we will have one more example of dictionaries so this is a common use case for dictionaries uh sometimes you want to be able to store information that will be useful in an algorithm for you so let's say i want to store all of the character counts inside of this string the counts of every single character that you see so what i can do is create a dictionary called character counts and i want my key to be characters and then the value being all of the times that i've seen that character in the string and so what we can do is just loop through all of the characters in example and say that if we've seen character in character counts then increment the value by one because we have uh you know another occurrence of that character and if we haven't seen that then initialize the value to zero and so if i print this out we'll see that after looping through the string it'll give us some very useful information for every single character that we've seen if we've if we or actually apologies this should be one because we've seen it uh let me fix that real quick okay so we've seen e only one time so it'll increment it by one uh but for the ones that we've seen more than once like e it'll say eight times it'll store all the character counts from character to integer and so if i want to let's say use this information in a later algorithm let's say i have a question that says find me all of the characters that have occurred at least four times in this in this string we can go ahead and declare that same kind of character counts dictionary loop through the string in the same fashion that we had before and we can say for every character in the example which is the string we can go ahead and increment it in the same fashion that we did before and while we're at it if we hit a point where after we increment a character count and it reaches four we've seen four instances of the character in that string we can append that character to the output list and i will print out what that will give us so in this example string that i wrote the characters that have occurred at least four times are e n o and t uh and also i still have that mistake that i need to solve so uh there you go these are this is the correct answer for that so uh hash tables or rather dictionaries in this case dictionaries are very useful for storing information in algorithms and they're very useful for storing data that won't exactly be structured as nicely inside of a list so that is a common use case we will give you guys some practice with that in homework so that is the end of this lecture sorry for going five minutes over it seems so from here on out we will be using python as a tool and so um what i mean by this is we are not going to spend a whole bunch of time with more python syntax lectures for all of our future lectures from here except for the rust lectures near the end of the semester or in the second half of the semester we are going to be using python as a tool and so what that means is we're not going to spend a whole bunch of time on syntax because syntax is boring and from here on out you should be able to for you know things that you might not know kind of fill in the gaps yourself but we have covered quite a bit of python this should be a very nice starting point very nice foundation for you and we will give you some examples and practice in the homework so any questions that you guys might have drop them in the chat but from here you guys are free to go apologies for going over people are asking about extra credit no extra credit was very easy and also i'm not sure if we will actually be offering extra credit
what's going down u. s. history people today in this video we're going to take a look at the New England colonies and the middle colonies no matter which book you're using for a push this video is going to help you out with all of the important stuff let's get started first important thing to keep in mind is where are these New England colonies and they're right here and as you can see there's a couple of things that characterize this region many of the people who are going to the New England colony are going for religious motives there's going to be much more of a mix of both male and female settlers many people are coming over as families and they're going to form tight-knit communities and they're going to have a mixed economy and make sure you know about the differences between the New England colonies and those in the Chesapeake region Virginia and Maryland the first of the New England colonies to be founded is the Plymouth Colony and really it's a result of religious conflict in Europe we call the Protestant Reformation spark dramatic changes in Europe and led to a rise of Puritanism and this happens in England as well and you get a group of people known as Puritans and their whole idea is they wanted to purify the church they were harassed by the monarchy over in England the King felt they were a threat many Puritans were arrested and they had these new ideas such as predestination that God already chose who was saved before even being born one group of Puritans the Pilgrims were much more radical hardcore these were separatists who wanted to break away from the Anglican Church they actually tried to get to Virginia but they get a little lost like most of the Europeans do coming over to the new world and they land over there in the Massachusetts Bay at what becomes known as Plymouth they're aboard the Mayflower you could see a replica right there over near Boston and before they even get to the colony they signed something called the Mayflower Compact and this was a agreement establishing a basic government based upon majority rule it established the basis for self-government and one of the key figures in the Plymouth Colony is going to be a guy by the name of William Bradford the colony is going to struggle in the beginning just like our friends over in Jamestown did but not as much the weather a little bit more favorable that's not as hot they don't have the mosquito problem and they're gonna get the help of a local Native American leader by the name of Squanto who's going to help this colony survive by teaching them how to farm and hunt and of course the famous story eventually they'll have the first Thanksgiving so the pilgrims are the first landing at Plymouth in 1620 but later on you get more Puritans coming over and they're going to establish the Massachusetts Bay Colony remember the Puritans want to reform the church they don't want to break away they get a charter from the king to establish the Massachusetts Bay Company and in 1629 a Puritan by the name of John Winthrop receives a Charter to establish that colony they're going to land in 1630 and what is today Boston and the goal of Winthrop in his Puritan followers is to as he said establish and to be as a city upon a hill Winthrop and his followers believed that they had an agreement with God to build this holy Society that would serve as a model for the rest of the world and so they're coming over here with these religious goals and Winthrop is going to serve as their first governor religion is extremely important in the New England colonies in fact education was required they established Harvard University to Train Puritan ministers but important to note religious freedom was reserved only for Puritans church membership was a requirement for participation in politics in fact in all the New England towns you had not only schools but also the church and the town hall meeting the town hall meeting becomes an important part of direct democracy in colonial America and especially the New England colonies all church-going males could participate in this form of direct democracy and in the New England colonies we have a mixed economy of both agriculture and commerce the weather was much cooler up there so they're not going to rely on cash crops like we're going to see in the Chesapeake or the south now keep in mind that religious toleration was not something that was practiced in the New England colonies and people who express religious dissent were very often quickly dealt with one such individual is Roger William he questioned the Puritan leadership of the colony he questioned the leaders and the doctrine and he called for the complete separation of church and state and he also criticized the colony's treatment of Native Americans he felt the colonies should pay the natives for their land what a crazy idea and because of his questioning of the colony he is banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony he's kicked out and he goes off to form his own colony known as Providence Rhode Island this is going to be a really important colony you could see that right there on the map because it's the first colony with complete religious freedom another individual you should know about is Anne Hutchinson she does something worse than Roger Williams she's a woman and she speaks out she challenged the accepted role of women within the church by openly speaking out against church leaders and just like Roger she is also kicked out of the Massachusetts Bay Colony make sure you know about the relationship between the colonists and Native Americans as the New England colonies grow you're going to see all the different ones which will eventually form there inevitably going to come into contact with native people there is a massacre that takes place in the 1630s called the qua war where the New England colonists nearly wipe out that the qua tribe and you could see in that illustration them attacking of the koala CH one of the things the colonists do is they form something called the New England Confederation in 1643 and this is a military alliance of all the New England colonies except Rhode Island and it's intended to defend the New England colonies against potential threats and the threats were many we got not only Native American threats but you have the presence of the Dutch a little bit further south and also the French out in the West England's in a civil war there's all sorts of problems in England so the colonies are kind of left to fend for themselves and so the New England Confederation is an example of colonial unity having a common purpose which is the defence of the colonies a really important war you should know about is King Philip's War or meticles war Medicom was his Native American name Metacom was the leader of the Wampanoag tribe and he starts organizing a resistance and alliance of native bribes to try to remove the Puritan settlements from his territory this time unlike during the Pequot War King Philip or Metacom has weapons you could see that in the image they're armed they have these deadly guns so they could fight back and have a shot but unfortunately for King Philip he's eventually killed and the resistance is crushed significant about King Phillip's war it is the last of the major Native American resistance to the New England colonies and not only is it the increasing population of the colonies but diseases are causing cultural and demographic changes for the native people in the New England region moving out of the New England colonies make sure you know about the middle colonies and we really call these the breadbasket colonies because they're going to produce a lot of the food for the colonists the first one is actually inhabited by the Dutch and before it becomes New York it was originally a Dutch colony called New Amsterdam you could see there in the purple some of the territory Holland controlled and what their colony looked like unfortunately for the Dutch they did not have a firm grasp on their colony and Charles ii sends a military expedition and grants the area to his brother James the Duke of York the territory of New Amsterdam is going to become New York and it's going to remain a very religious and ethnically diverse colony another important colony is Pennsylvania founded in 1681 by William Penn as a refuge for Quakers he wanted to create a holy experiment the group Quakers was actually known as the religious Society of Friends Quakers was their nickname their passivist they were treated very poorly in England and so William Penn wants to establish this colony and the crown grants him a block of land this is a proprietorship Penn great say very liberal colony there is representative assembly people are voting for representation he seeks to treat the Native Americans very fairly by buying land from them rather than just taking it there is widespread religious toleration and freedom in Pennsylvania and certain rights are extended to women as well they have a right to be active in the church and to even be preachers things that did not happen in the New England colonies some key things about the middle colonies to keep in mind is they are going to be demographically religiously and ethnically diverse so you've got a mix of people in this area whether it be the Dutch the Quakers Protestants Puritans and so on and their economics are like I said breadbasket they're going to be producing food especially wheat in corn but they're also going to be involved in trade and other things now that we've broken down all the different regions of the colonies make sure you understand some colonial policy remember the colonies are there because of this economic theory known as mercantilism the colonies exist to enrich the mother country in this case England however in this early period you have this thing called solitary neglect England was involved in its own internal conflicts such as the English Civil War and so they're going to be largely indifferent to the colonies they're going to kind of be letting them do their own thing for a big chunk of this time there are some exceptions though we have some policies that are put in place some mercantile laws such as the Navigation Acts and this is really England trying to keep watch over its colonies the navigation acts did things like one trade must be carried only in English or colonial ships to trade how to pass through English ports before it can move on to other places such as France and three certain enumerated goods certain Goods that are spelled out from the colonies could be exported only to England and it starts off with tobacco but other goods are only allowed to be trade with England there is very loose enforcement in the beginning in fact smuggling was a major problem the colonists were very often trading with the French and the Dutch and others but later on the English are going to try to deal with that problem stay tuned there are going to be instances where England's going to try to clamp down on the colonies you could see that whole region in the green is going to be something called the dominion of New England in 1686 this is implemented by England to increase royal control over the colonies and the king sends over an individual by the name of Sir Edmund Andros to regulate and keep these colonies in check and he does a couple of things most of which are very unpopular such as enforcing the Navigation Acts which the colonies were largely ignoring limiting the town hall meetings and other things and it's important to note the goals and interest of European leaders in England for example very often at times diverge from those of the colonists and this led to mistrust on both sides of the Atlantic this dominion of New England will eventually end with the Glorious Revolution and 1688 which we'll take a look at next time and until next time I hope you learned a whole bunch of stuff and if you did click like on the video tell your friends about Joe's productions subscribe to the channel you have any questions

welcome back to Jos productions today we're going to break down English colonial society what was life like in the colonies politics religion slavery all that stuff we're going to cover in this video key point to keep in mind regional differences existed between the British colonies remember we have the New England region the middle colonies the Chesapeake and the Lower South and there were reasons for these differences who came to these colonies why they came and really important you understand the environmental and geographic variations of these different regions such as climate Natural Resources and how this influenced their development and as you can see on the map right there some of the different variations between these regions and real quick review make sure you know the differences in similarities between the Chesapeake versus the New England colonies they love asking about this topic so quick review of the New England region remember there were largely Puritan religious motives for colonization and although these individuals whether it be the Pilgrims or the Puritans are coming over for religious motives keep in mind they are not tolerant of other religions they're going to develop a closed-end homogeneous society settlements are settled around towns the life expectancy is longer than the Chesapeake it's also longer than what it was in England it's a much more stable society compared to the Chesapeake region there is going to be the importance of religion in the colonies obviously family life is going to be key to the colonies and education in fact they're going to require schools to be built and as you can see on that town map schools churches you got it all right there town hall meetings are going to be a unique characteristic of the New England society all adult male church members could participate in this direct democracy large number of immigrants are going to come to the New England colonies and they're also going to have a very high birthrate because you're going to have more of an equal distribution of men and women there's not going to be big farming no cash crops because of the long winters and short growing season so this area is going to have a mixed economy you're going to have some agriculture trade shipbuilding and like I said Boston's going to play a key role in the economic health of this region like we mentioned make sure you can compare the New England colonies especially to the Chesapeake which is Virginia and Maryland but the southern colonies shared some characteristics with one another they are largely especially in the beginning a male-dominated society remember the first people to come to Jamestown were men looking to get wealthy this region has a much warmer climate longer growing season life was harsh you have all sorts of diseases like malaria hot and humid and you have a lower birth rate because there's less women in this region whereas the New England colonies are a tight knit society the southern colonies the southern plantation colonies are going to have a defined hierarchy of wealth and status you're going to get the rise of the southern gentry so much wider gap between the wealthy and the poor in the Chesapeake and the southern colonies in fact a big reason for that is the rise of the cash crop plantation economies you know the southern planters are going to be the top dogs in the colony they're going to dominate not only the economics but also the politics of the region so in the Chesapeake you get the importance of tobacco remember in South Carolina you get rice and even down in the British West Indies you have sugarcane there are fewer cities that develop in the south obviously because of the agricultural nature of the economy but it's important to keep in mind the labor system slavery existed everywhere in the 13 British colonies but you're going to have this transition from indentured servants to slavery especially after Bacon's Rebellion and there's a lot of different reasons for this transition to slavery make sure you know them one there's an abundance of land - there's a shortage of indentured servants that are coming over to the new world 3 there's no way to enslave the native population they would just run away or attack or die of disease and 4 there's European demand for colonial Goods so the transition gets made to African slavery in fact in South Carolina the majority of the population is going to be made up of African slaves and throughout the South slavery is going to play a much larger role in the southern economy so a little bit more explanation about slavery in colonial America one is the triangular trade route this is a three-part trade route forming a triangle slaves and goods are moving from Africa to the Caribbean and to the colonies and you could see some of those goods that are brought between the regions also very often goods would be going to Europe as well slaves brought over largely from West Africa are going to experience something horrendous dehumanizing called the Middle Passage you could see the conditions that these individuals were brought over in it was all about maximizing profit and bringing large numbers of people to the New World keep in mind slavery in North America was race-based it was based upon ideas and perceptions of superiority and slaves were considered property slave culture is going to develop as a blend of African and American traditions blending these two kind of cultures together to create a truly unique African American culture you'll see this in African American religion song and so on it's important to note that there is a variety of tribes being brought over from different parts of Africa and they're not just going to the 13 colonies as you can see on this graphic right there the vast majority of slaves are going to be going to the Caribbean islands and also to Brazil but slavery in British North America although much smaller is going to play a huge role in colonial society there are going to be some attempts at rebellion the most famous and one of the few was the Stono uprising in 1739 South Carolina slaves along the Stono River tried to get to Spanish Florida where they were promised freedom but unfortunately the rebellion was defeated and it contributed to stricter laws black code slave codes that regulated the movement and the freedoms of slaves in the colonies in spite of the fact that there were few rebellions it's important to note that there was different forms of resistance resistance to slavery was common and it took the form of work slowdowns running away faking illness and other things to kind of disrupt the slave system aside from the issue slavery religion created kind of problems in the colonies and one of the big things was the religious passion was fading in the New England colonies fewer and fewer people were having a conversion so less Puritans practicing means the colony is losing its original mission to deal with this the halfway covenant was passed in 1660 to in the New England colonies and it said individuals could become partial church members even if they did not have a conversion and the idea behind this was to lessen the Puritan practices they're going to be less strict in order to increase church membership and it was successful at doing so and as we talk about religion in this issue of religious practice it's important to note that religious freedom the Massachusetts Bay Colony did not allow freedom of religion but some religious toleration existed in a few British colonies for example you saw Pennsylvania with the Quakers Rhode Island separation of church and state with Roger Williams in Maryland with its Catholic population extended religious toleration but only to Christians and religious freedom is going to be a key cornerstone of the new nation so there are traditions established during the colonial period a real wacky event happens in 1692 in Salem Massachusetts it's the Salem witch trials during the trials 19 people are hung and one person was even pressed to death that's a scene in one of the museums in Salem gruesome stuff most of the accused were from the money-making class and the people who were accusing them were farmers and really what you see in Salem is it reflects a growing tension over the changing nature of the colony from a religious kind of motives to a profit-driven commercialism so you see the tension between the rich and the poor in colonial New England speaking of religion a really important event that all colonies experienced was the Great Awakening many people were tired of the boring sermons that were traditionally practiced throughout the colonies and the Great Awakening was a religious revival in the 1730's 240s that spread throughout the colonies this is the spread of religious feeling throughout the colonies many people convert it to different religions and some key figures you should know about one Jonathan Edwards he sparks the Great Awakening with his sermons he basically said God was angry at human sinfulness and his most famous sermon sinners in the hands of an angry god some scary stuff another figure is George Whitefield he introduced a new energized style of evangelical preaching George Whitefield led many revival meetings were sinners professed being saved and conversions took place out on the frontier a key part of the Great Awakening was this idea that ordinary people with faith and belief in God could understand the Gospels without the Church ministers telling them what to believe this divided people new lights were supporters of the Great Awakening old lights were against this new style of preaching and the impact of the Great Awakening was huge you have new universities forming such as Dartmouth Princeton Brown some of the Ivy League universities today they start off as religious based institutions this leads to greater religious independence and diversity you have all sorts of new churches forming you can see on the map the different colors with the different types of churches throughout the colonies and as a result the strengthened calls for separation of church and state if you have lots of different religions you can't have any one church supported by the state and finally this is the first mass movement shared amongst all of the colonists this great awakening spread throughout the colonies it did not matter your social status your region and it happened throughout and so this was a shared experience and key to this is people are changing the way they view Authority common people are making their own decisions with regard to religion and later on this resistance to established Authority will be extended towards the British so keep in mind all of the impacts of the rate awakening we've already mentioned the idea of mercantilism remember that were various mercantile laws that were passed to regulate colonial trade and to benefit England you have the navigation acts the molasses Act and the basic principle behind mercantilism was that nations such as England should become self-sufficient and the colonies should enrich the mother country however the goals and interests of European leaders for example in England at times diverge from those of colonial citizens in other words many colonists did not like these laws such as the Navigation Acts luckily there was this period of solitary neglect throughout the early 17th century where the British had relative indifference to colonial governance they kind of just let them do their thing there were some things that made the colonists smile over the mercantile policies for example colonial shipbuilding developed especially in the New England colonies as a result of these requirements that Goods must travel in either British or colonial ships as a result of England being their mama the colonists were provided protection of the British military and mercantile policies provided Chesapeake tobacco farmers a monopoly in England remember certain enumerated Goods could only be sold to England tobacco was one of them however there were some reasons to be mad some bad things about mercantilism it restricted development of colonial manufacturing they had to buy the goods from British manufacturing so therefore the economy of the colonies did not diversify very often they had to buy higher priced manufactured goods from England and farmers had to accept lower prices for their enumerated crops so although they had a guaranteed market they could not sell them to the highest buyer and this was no bueno in the minds of many colonists resentment over laws and posed from a distant government in London did lead to times of resistance recall England attempted to integrate the colonies into a coherent hierarchical Imperial structure with the dominion of New England Sir Edmund and came over started enforcing the navigation act trying to bring more money over to London and eventually that falls apart in 1688 with the Glorious Revolution basically under the Glorious Revolution there is an overthrow of James ii and William and Mary take the throne and this is important in the colonies for a couple of reasons one over in England they put limits on the power of the monarchy and the colonists once the Glorious Revolution takes place they rebelled against the dominion of New England colonists successfully resisted some English policies however it's important to note that the big turning point will happen in 1763 at the end of the Seven Years War check out the next video and finally colonial politics there was the gradual development of democratic institutions in the colonies and colonial experiences with self-government and you're going to see this in various examples we covered in previous videos such as the Mayflower Compact the town hall meetings the House of Burgesses the elected representative assemblies in places like Pennsylvania keep in mind many people were still excluded for example there were property requirements or religious qualifications and England ultimately was still in charge so in the colonies there wasn't widespread democratization taking place there was a ruling colonial elite that was usually made up of the wealthy or people in the powerful in the church but the colonies are beginning to develop different political institutions an example of colonial political life evolving during this time could be seen in the Sanger case in 1733 which advanced the freedom of the press and basically what happened that newspaper that you see right there was printed by John Peter Zenger and he printed a newspaper that was critical of the royal governor in New York and that led some people to get that face you see right there as a result of this newspaper he is charged with libel but the jury ruled that Zanger was not guilty and what happens is in the Saenger case you see that the it's rule that you could be critical of elected officials if the statements were true and although this case does not allow full freedom of the press it does establish principles that allow people to be critical of those in power something that's going to be very key to a healthy democracy and the last thing to keep in mind is there was ethnically of the colonies as well most of the people who came over for from England but you get a growing group of people coming from other parts of the world we've already mentioned the large African population in South Carolina forcibly brought here because of slavery we also have the huge amount of people from England many of them Puritans up in this region but you also get a growing scots-irish population in places like Pennsylvania and as you can see on this map the people that settled the thirteen colonies came from all sorts of different ethnic groups that's going to do it for this video thank you for watching if the video helped you out click like

Hello everybody and welcome. How is everybody today? Great. Well, I'm delighted to have the opportunity to be giving the DeVane Lectures. And the DeVane Lectures, as you can tell, from looking around you double as being a regular Yale course for credit that students can take for credit and lectures that are open to the general public. These lectures are going to deal with power and politics in today's world and by today's world, I'm gonna mean the 30 years since 1989 and the 30 years since 1989 are and have been an incredibly tumultuous period of very great change. And that's for xxx unusual. For instance, if you compare it to the previous 40 years in most of the advanced capitalist democracies, they were a period of relative stability after World War II. In most countries, it was an era of great prosperity even countries recovering from World War II like the countries of Europe were being rebuilt with Marshal Plan aid and it was a period, partly for demographic reasons, of very great political stability for people who grew up in that period. Internationally, as well, it was a period of very great stability because partly, because of the Cold War. It's true we had episodes like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War but as the Vietnam War indicates, most of the conflicts within the Cold War were played out as you like, as proxy wars in other parts of the world. From the point of view of the citizens of the Western democracies, except for those who are actually fighting in Vietnam, it was a far-off war that didn't have a great impact on the stability of people's lives and that is very different from what has been experienced since 1989; time, if you like, has speeded up a great deal. We've seen incredible change in three decades. And those are the three decades that I am going to be exploring. One pedagogical challenge that presents is that for some of us in this room, the last three decades are etched into our minds as like it was yesterday. We experienced them in real time but there are many people in this room who were never born until long after that. For them, whether it's the last 40 years or the last 60 years, 40 years or the 60 years after World War II, it's all history. One of the first things I need to do and I'm gonna try and make this a regular practice during the course is I need to take everybody back and to make people understand who weren't there what it was like and then to remind people who've lived through it of things that they might have forgotten. So let's just go back to 1989 in Berlin. - The Berlin Wall, once it divided East from West, now on its way to becoming an artifact of history. (upbeat music) This the CBS Evening News. Dan Rather, reporting tonight from in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany. Good evening. These are the sights and sounds of the continuing celebration of Germans about the symbolic, not the literal, at least, not yet but the symbolic tearing down of the Berlin Wall. It's impossible to completely describe how deeply Germans feel about what's happened here. East German border guards tonight were literally tearing down portions of the wall itself, not the whole wall but portions of the wall to make it easier for East Germans to come into West Berlin and as the joyous hordes of Berliners were still streaming through the wall, the East German communist government said they can come and go permanently, they can come into West Berlin, have a look and then come back home again with no special documents required. Today, what goes through your mind and heart? - Well, of course, I look back to all those years of hardship for the families even more than for the country as a whole and it's moving to see families getting together again. My feeling is that we are very close to an end of the artificial division of Berlin and I also believe we are close to the point where the parts of Germany will become much closer together. This, of course, only within the reasonable European framework. Anyone know who that was? Xxx Billy Braun, the former Chancellor of Germany who actually would die a couple of years, three years after that, so he was one of the celebratory crowd at that time. So that might give you a little sense of the shock and the enthusiasm that people experienced in the latter days of 1989. This had been a period in which the Soviet Union was clearly losing its grip on Eastern Europe. It wasn't just Germany. Right across Eastern Europe, all through 1989, there had been these massive resistance movements developing and the Soviet Union was losing, it was clearly not in a position to intervene in these countries. And they were shedding totalitarian control for the first time in decades. Of course, the great exception which we will be talking about next week was in China where demonstrations in Tiananmen Square that June had come out, meant a very different result but in most of the world, after 1989, it seemed like democracy was on the March. We saw the democratization of all of the former Soviet Union bloc countries in Eastern Europe even places like South Africa which had been mired in a bitter conflict for decades transitioned in the early 1990s to a multi-racial democracy. The problems in Northern Ireland finally settled with the Good Friday Accords in 1997. Even Israel-Palestine which had been one of the most intractable conflicts for decades and decades seemed to be moving towards a resolution in the early 1990s. There were the Oslo Accords, the PLO and the Israeli government were negotiating a settlement. Anyone who was in Israel or the West Bank at that time anticipated that there was going to be a settlement until the assassination of one of the key protagonists, Yitzhak Rabin in November of 1995. And that would lead to an unraveling of that potential settlement but in the early 1990s, it's really I think difficult to overstate the enthusiasm for change. This is the period when Francis Fukuyama was talking about the end of history by which he meant that liberal democracy was sweeping the world. In fact, at the turn of the 21st century, we finally went from a world in which most countries in the world were not democracies by most standard measures to a world in which most countries were democracies by most standard measures. So it's not surprising that one would have had the kind of enthusiasm that Fukuyama had at that time and that was almost, what's the word? Just snowballing across so much of the developed world. Enormous confidence in democratic capitalism and enormous confidence in the idea that many people were gonna be lifted out of poverty and that the world was heading for a kind of benign equilibrium, as an economist would say, Fukuyama's end of history idea. now let's fast-forward three decades and let's stay in Germany and here's a very different thing to look at. (speaking in foreign language) (audience cheering) (speaking in foreign language) So he's a leader of the Alternative for Deutschland, far-right anti-immigrant, anti-system political party and what he is celebrating is that they have crossed the 5% threshold. This is the AFP here on this graph. Germany has a 5% threshold to get seated in the parliament so if you don't get 5%, you get no seats, they hadn't gotten 5% before and now they had won 5% and so they saw themselves as getting a foothold in German electoral politics for the first time. Germany, in 2017 was coming out of a situation in which there had been a grand coalition between the SPD which is the left of said Social Democratic Party and the right of center CDU, Christian Democratic Party led by Angela Merkel. And the SPD were very unhappy, they had been in this grand coalition for a long time and they found that they were paying a huge price with their supporters. They were getting less and less of the vote for reasons we'll talk about later in the course and they announced that they were not gonna participate in a grand coalition again and they were gonna go into opposition and rebuild themselves. Angela Merkel then spent the next six months, Alternative for Deutschland were and still are seen as beyond the pale, nobody will form a government with them. So she spent the next six months trying to put together a coalition with the Green Environmentalist Party and the so-called Free Democrats. The Free Democrats would be what we would think of as, in this country, as Rand Paul libertarians. They are for small government, low regulation across the board. It's not surprising that she couldn't do it because the greens want green regulation. They want environmental regulation. That's their raison d'etre and the Free Democrats want no regulation or certainly, less regulation. So they stumbled along in and out of negotiations but they weren't able to form a coalition. However, over the course of that six months, all the opinion polls showed that the AFD, the Alternative for Deutschland was actually rising in popularity. And so the German president was very against having another election in the face of the stalemate with the Social Democrats refusing to join in a grand coalition on the one hand and Merkel's inability to construct a different coalition on the other. They all knew that if they went for another election, the AFD would do even better. So finally, after much hand-wringing, the SPD was persuaded after extracting a very big set of concessions, including six ministries and the Finance Ministry. They were persuaded to go back into a grand coalition even though a lot of their membership didn't want it. So terrified were they of the prospect of another election in which the far right would do even better. So we thought German politics was kind of settling down at this point but the following year, this is what you see happening. - [Presnter] German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who's led Germany for 13 years has offered to step down as her party's leader and said she won't run for office again after her term ends in 2021. Her announcement came a day after her party, the Christian Democratic Union, saw a disappointing performance in a key regional election in the state of Hesse. The far-right, Alternative for Germany party claimed more than a dozen seats in Hesse's Parliament for the first time. The entire migrant party now controls seats in all 16 of Germany's state Parliament's plus the National Bundestag and European Parliament. - So there it is. They had also done very poorly in the Bavarian regional elections. They had hemorrhaged about 10% of their vote to the AFD in these regional elections and by the way, the SPD wasn't very happy either because they were hemorrhaging support to the greens. And this is something we'll see playing out in many European countries. The establishment parties are shrinking and becoming weaker and the parties on the fringes are growing and becoming stronger. And it was impossible not to start thinking about the past and thinking particularly about the 1920s and 30s. (speaking in foreign language) - [Presenter] As a result of the elections of July, 1932, the Nazis became the biggest party in Germany with 37% of the vote. - So if you wanna go back to the 1930s, you can see that that video was about the July 1932 election and you can see what happened in the subsequent elections that it was a very unstable system. They were having multiple elections and of course, 18 months later, Hitler came to power. And if you go to Germany, you hear very anxious people talking about is this back to the future? Is 2017 and 2018 some kind of replay of the empowerment of extremist parties and of course, it wasn't just Germany. In 2016 we had massive shocks delivered to establishment parties with the Brexit result in the UK and Donald Trump's populist stampede to the presidency in the US, both widely unanticipated outcomes by most of the establishment parties, pundits and politicians. And you could go around the world. In the Austrian elections of 2016, people are very relieved that in the runoff, the Green candidate actually defeated the far-right quite handsomely by 54 to 46% but if you look at the legislature, again, you see the far-right gaining ground, the establishment parties coming in fourth and fifth in the 2017 legislative elections. These are the parties that would normally have come in first and second while the far-right party increased its vote, putting them a close third with 51 seats, while the Greens fell below the threshold and won nothing or if you look at Belgium, you see a center-right party retains its majority but if you drill down a little bit, you can see that there was an increase of support for the far-right Flemish Vlaams Belang which received almost 12% of the vote gaining seats. If you look at Italy, you can see the center-left party ceding power to the center-right but many of the votes for the center-right party are coming from the league, so-called, again, a far right-wing populist party which ends up with 125 seats and 17% of the popular vote, of 109 seats and I could put up another seven or eight or nine slides of different countries that basically tell the same stories in country after country across Europe both Eastern Europe and Western Europe, including countries that we thought of as bastions of civil social democratic stability like Sweden. You see these far-right parties doing well, Turkey, Latin America, elsewhere, where anti-establishment parties that sometimes also verge on being anti-system parties are gaining ground in many legislatures. So if you think about the contrast between the videos of 1989 and where the world has been since 2016, it couldn't be more dramatic and in some ways, it's a big downer but my first thing I wanna say is don't get too depressed. It's not all of course, for depression. The central questions of this course are three. How did we get from there to here? What are the challenges and prospects going forward? And most importantly, in the last part of the course, how could we get to a better place in many of the countries that we're talking about? We'll spend a lot of time on the US but not exclusively in the US. I should say a little bit about the distinctive approach that I'm gonna be taking in these lectures, not to say it's the best approach; there are many ways to look at this kind of material but it is the approach that I'm going to be using. And the first thing I would say about this approach is that I'm going to be studying history with the tools of political science and political theory on the one hand but also using history to keep political science and political theory honest. So what do I mean by that? Well, one thing that is remarkable about the events of 1989 is that they supply us with a terrific natural experiment from the point of view of social scientists. If you look at the literature, for example, of people who studied European democracies, before 1989, they were essentially cycling endless numbers of theories through the same old data set that everybody had had for four decades. And they didn't have any a big exogenous change. 1989 is a big shock to the system and suddenly, we have, for instance, in Western Europe, in Eastern Europe, the addition of a whole lot of new parliamentary democracies. That creates possibilities of thinking about long-established conventional wisdom, testing theories against new data which is the gold standard for social science rather than testing theories on data out of which the theories have been developed, which tend to result in what statisticians call just-so stories, fitting the curve to the data. Suddenly we have all this new data, coming along in real time. If you think about and we're gonna talk some about some of the standard theories in political science like modernization theory, which is a theory about how as economies modify, certain kinds of political changes become more likely. It was long held that modernization produces democracy. There were many variants of modernization theory. And we will talk about some of the differences among them but now we have new data and whether modernizing economies will produce democracy. It is long been conventional wisdom that democratic systems are incompatible with state-run economies. If we look at what's happened since 1989, we've gone to market economies in some of the post-communist systems but others like China and Vietnam have become state capitalist systems of a certain kind while retaining non democratic politics. So we'll have cause to think about theories of that general sort. There's been a lot of conventional wisdom about the conditions for stable democracy that suddenly can be put to the test on a whole slew of new democracies. Is it all the economy stupid or do beliefs of citizens matter? And what kinds of beliefs matter and what about the beliefs of elites? All of these things, we can look at again, in new contexts. So we have lots of new data to think about them, provided by this dramatic break of 1989. There's a lot of conventional wisdom about the relations between business, government and labor that has built up among political economists and political scientists over the last several decades before 1989. We now have big power shifts partly because communism as an economic system has been taken off the table. Well if communism, as an economic system, is taken off the table, how does that restructure relations between business government and labor? It turns out it really has a big impact on those relationships. So that's another of the topics we will be looking at. How do electoral systems affect things like inequality, provision of environmental legislation and public goods? A lot of conventional wisdom there about which types of democracies are more likely to do that and which are less likely to do that start to look before and after 1989 and we're gonna discover that some of the conventional wisdom needs rethinking. So on the one hand we're bringing the tools of political science and the theories of political science to bear on the data that's thrown up by this last 30 years of history. On the other hand, we're using that data to keep the political scientists honest, precisely because we have this whole smorgasbord of new results as a social scientist would put it but then I also said I'm gonna use the tools of political theory. So political theory, I should confess, truth in advertising by my first profession, if extended is a profession is I'm a political theorist. I cut my teeth in the world of political philosophy. I'm in normative things about what should happen, how the world should be organized, rather than empirical work on how it is organized. We are definitely gonna be thinking about normative questions here as well as we go along, what should happen, what might have happened but the confession I need to make about my home discipline is that it reminds me of the story about the fella who goes up to a farmer in Donegal and says how do I get to Dublin and the answer that comes back is well, I wouldn't start from here, sonny. That is to say much of political philosophy develops theories that take no account of where we actually are and how the theories that people argue about in the journals and in the literature actually could be implemented in the world, if at all. And this spills over into normative arguments made by other scholars. Thomas Piketty in his book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, argues for a 4% global wealth tax. Well, good luck with that. Who's gonna implement a 4% global wealth tax. So when I think about normative questions, it's gonna be from the perspective of how might the goals that we think are desirable actually be achieved. I am going to spend, as we go along, through the different topics that we're gonna be discussing. I am gonna be focusing on paths not taken, things that might have been done differently and here the sorts of things I'm gonna be talking about are things like NATO expansion, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the NATO alliance, we'll talk about this next week which was expanded over the next several decades to include most, eventually, all of the former Soviet bloc countries and there were overtures, also to including former Soviet states like Georgia and several others. I'll, talk about this Ukraine, Georgia and Ukraine were both talking about, joining NATO that part of the reason the Soviet Union invaded Ukraine. So we will talk about whether there was a path not taken at that time French president Francois Mitterrand thought that NATO should be shut down at the end of the Cold War it was a defensive alliance that had lost its purpose. How realistic was that? how might the world have been different had that happened we're going to be talking about the Global War on Terror I should in after 9/11 when, we invaded first Afghanistan and then Iraq. Was there another path that would have been politically viable that would have led the world in a different direction. We will talk about the response to the financial crisis of 2008 in 2009, again what were their possibilities that, were, ignored or overlooked that might have been both politically feasible and more polished effective in the sense of policy and so that brings me to underscore the third feature of the approach that I am going to take in this course which is when you look at, people who talk about public policy, it tends either to be policy wonks who just go on about what would be, the best policy or political scientists who talk about why some policies get adopted in some systems and not in other systems but there's very little discussion of what is the effective political way of achieving a good policy or the effective political way of blocking a bad policy and so when I talk about innovations in the last part of the course, it's very much going to be in a way that marries considerations of politics to considerations of good public policy so, that that is the flavor of what we're going to be doing here and as I said it's not the only way one might study these materials ,but it's the way that we're going to be doing it in this course. Let me talk a little bit about the shape of the course. It falls into five, sections. The the first one is going to starting on Monday deal with the collapse of communism and its aftermath. There we going to look at collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in Russia, in China and in Vietnam. Although I will talk about some other countries along the way. We're going to talk about the rise of a unipolar world, until 1989, we had a bipolar world in which, as I said a lot of actual stability, that came about as a byproduct of the Cold War at least among the the major powers even if they maintained this stability, partly by, acting out their conflicts in proxy wars in, Asia, Africa and at America but it by and large the great powers were the nucleus standoff worked and we didn't have a major conflict between them. Now we have gone to a unipolar world dominated, by a single power ,after 1989. How does that restructure politics and the possibilities for politics that will be also part of our concern. And then I'm going to talk about the, politics of the economics. What I'm going to call the rise of neoliberalism at home and the Washington Consensus abroad and this is put on this is basically it comes to, exist because of the collapse of an alternative to capitalism, the disappearance of communism as a viable, political system as a viable economic system and so you have this idea that's often called neoliberalism that basically has three elements. Its trade deregulation, trade deals getting rid of restraints on trade, getting rid of internal regulation within countries, and massive privatization of formerly state assets that was called, the neoliberal approach to political public political economy. And when it's translated into a set of recommendations or requirements for countries in the developing world, it was called the Washington Consensus, was essentially adopted by the World Bank by the IMF as a condition for giving loans to developing countries and it, was essentially taking neoliberalism global. And so the, post communist era is marked by, this massive confidence in, the the capacity of unregulated or mildly regulated free-market capitalism, to deliver the best results, for every country in the world then we're going to talk about the new global order, that is ushered in by this. We're going to look at whether democracy really was on the march the people thought about a potential we had talked again the conventional wisdom in political science was that the democratization had preceded in three waves. The first wave being the gradual expansion of the franchise in what we think of today as the older democracies, the second wave being decolonization in Africa and Asia and Latin America after World War II. The third wave coming in 1989 to 1991 and people started to wonder whether there's a fourth wave now with democratization of South Africa with settlements in places like Northern Ireland, initially with the Arab Spring people wondered whether we were going to start to see more democracy as part of this new global order. Then we're going to look at the international institutions that developed in this global order, we'll talk about things like, the International Criminal Court which for the first time would hold dictators to account for their activities of repression. There was the creation and of something called a doctrine at the United Nations called the responsibility to protect. Responsibility to protect, says that this was in the wake of, things like the Rwanda genocide of 1994 and what happened in Kosovo, in 1999 eventually we got responsibility to protect where the UN was said all governments are going to be held accountable for severe human rights violations within their own territories and if they don't respect them, the UN is going to intervene, militarily this is you know a big change we're saying we're not going to respect the sovereignty of Nations so the new international order seems to be, affecting not only relations among countries but relations within them. The third part of the course I'm calling the end of the end of history and this is really, has its ultimate roots with 9/11 and the emergence of the global war on terror. The invasion of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and eventually the collapsing Syria we're going to see that the idea that history was heading in some benign direction, was getting harder and harder for people to hold on to. we're going to look at the resurgence of state capitalism. we're going to look at what China was, has been and is doing in Africa. We are going to be looking at Russia's resurgence as a global power, they had been back on their heels, for much of the 1990s and early 2000 but now they became actively involved, in, the Middle East and elsewhere, we're going to, look at, the new role of business in many political conflicts around the world sometimes with benign purposes in mind, but often not and so we're going to start to see a much messier politics. The fourth part of the course, is about the new politics of insecurity. This is really ushered in not so much by the financial crisis itself, but by the way in which governments responded to the financial crisis and this will be one of the areas where we will be looking at paths not taken but, we will see that there was, growing insecurity in the workforces of many of the advanced democracies that had been building up for decades, and the financial crisis, threw into sharp relief the fact that most governments were not doing much about it if anything at all and in fact that they ended up bailing out the elites, while doing nothing much, for the people who have been most harmed in the crisis and so we will look at the response to, the financial crisis in a number of countries particularly in the US and then we will all in the last part of the course, what is to be done that great Leninists slogan, we will be looking at, two things really. First how the, voter sentiment in these countries was, so poorly misdiagnosed by so many, political elites and people in control of political parties, misdiagnosed to the point where not only did they fail to respond, to the growing economic insecurity, that was experienced by many, many millions of workers within their own countries. They were actually implementing political reforms that were likely to make things worse. And so the last part of the course will be looking at those two interacting issues. What sorts of economic policies were pursued or failed to be pursued. What kinds of policies might have been pursued and how did the reform of political systems over the last 15 or 20 years, make the problem worse and that will lead me, to make some arguments, about how we should, think about, politics going forward. So, that is what we're going, to be doing. It's a big menu, we have, you know we have 26 now soon to be 25 lectures in which to explore it. I'm going to, before breaking today, I'm going to talk about a few logistical matters. One is that I have been asked to announce but you can see for yourself, that the Office of Public Affairs is, taking pictures and these lectures are going to be videotaped. And this will include, we will have microphones so we can have questions from the floor and interaction but you should know that, this is all being tape recorded and so anything you say can be taken down and used in evidence against you. So, a couple of other logistical things. One is I want to introduce Christina Seyfreid. Christina, she's the head teaching fellow for the course so for she will be overseeing the grading of students who are taking the course, for, credit and she will also be working with me, in, running office hours for people from the community, which we're both going to be doing. I'll say a little bit more about that in a minute but, you will see more of Christina as we go along. Office hours I'm gonna be having office hours in Rosenkranz room 201 from 10:00 to 12:00 on Wednesdays and Fridays. The presumption there is that from 10:00 to 12:00, Yale students have priority. These are walk-in office hours not by appointment and on 10:00 to 12:00 on Fridays, people from the community have priority but who knows if anyone will show up but that's the way it'll work 201 Rosenkranz Hall which is right opposite, the new colleges up the street. Christina is going to have office hours for people from the community on Thursdays, from 5:00 to 7:00 at a place yet to be announced and one thing we're going to do, the office hours are not just going to vanish into the ether we're going to, Christina and I are going to film five sessions over the course of the semester, where she and I will discuss what's come up in the office hours and we will post that, on the course website. I do this with my Coursera course and it proves to be quite helpful. So, we will get questions that have come up in the office hours both in our office hours and in office hours, between the students and the Teaching Fellows, that they will be participating as well and we will publish those videos of the office hours on the course website. Access to reading. Anyone who has a Yale ID can get almost all of the readings on Canvas, there's a few, I think three of the book, we're using too much for copyright reasons to put them on Canvas but they're all in the library for anyone who doesn't want to buy any. The, people from the community we have, made available in the New Haven Public Library if you don't have access to Canvas us a couple of sets, of the books that we're being using in the course or you can get them that way. Those who are taking, the students who are taking the course for credit the official exam is the last afternoon of the last day of exams, which I'm sure some of you have already bought plane tickets that are, inconsistent with that. So actually we're going to have to alternate exams. One on December 11th and this is primarily to accommodate SOM students because, of the timing of the SOM elective, exam period and that exam will, if we can arrange it be held at SOM, and then there'll be, but others can take it then as well if they want. And then there'll be an another alternate exam on Friday the 13th so there'll be different times at which people can take the exam. Policy here will be no laptops, no screens, no iPhones. I came to this policy a couple of years ago. It definitely works better. It's just too tempting to be doing that Amazon shopping for your grandmother's birthday present that you forgot about and it's very distracting not only for the people around you but it's also distracting for me, to teach. We will post the slides on Canvas and on the course web page off the lectures so people will have access, to the slides. What you'll find is if you go and you look at the slides on Canvas, they'll look like they'd been turned into a PDF and the video will not play. If you want to play the video, you have to download the slides and then it will read, it will regurgitate as playable videos, so it is possible to play the video, yes so no laptops, no screens, no phones and everything, everything I put up here will be available to you, so you don't have to take copious notes of what appears on slides. Comments, questions. Yes, sir, you're gonna have to yell. We will have microphones here starting next time. (student speaking faintly) You can't. So that's why we put a set of the reasonings in a New Haven library and the reason for it, it's not just Yale being mean. It turns out there're two sets of copyright rules so if you are photocopying chapters from a book, you are allowed to take up to 10% of the book, otherwise you have to buy the book if you're using it but universities, for their students, have a more permissive rule. So we can take more than 10% from a book. I've forgotten what the exact number is but it's much more than 10%. We can take more than 10% from a book and put it up on Canvas if it's only available to Yale students but if we made them available to the general public, Yale would be violating copyright laws. So that's why we have bought two complete sets of the books and put them in a New Haven Public Library, from which we have been xeroxing most of this stuff. So you should be able to get the vast majority of the readings if you wanna go down there and get them. Other questions, comments, observations? If there's a question in your mind, it's probably in the mind of 30 other people so they'll be grateful if you ask it. Yeah, you just have to yell. (student speaking faintly) Are we gonna look at the European Union as well as what? (student speaking faintly) We're certainly gonna look at the growth of the European Union and the expansion of the European Union since, in fact, we're gonna talk about it next class. We're gonna look at the expansion of the European Union since the Cold War. I'll talk very briefly about the early, this course is really post 1989. We've just hired David Engerman and Arne Westad, who are both cold war historians who are gonna be teaching courses on the Cold War. So if you really wanna deal with the post-war Europe from into war Europe II to the end of the Cold War, these are the guys who are gonna be teaching that stuff going forward in Yale College. So I'm very consciously not doing that. So I will talk about the way in which the European Union was formed which has had a lot to do with its current troubles but mostly, I'm gonna focus on since 1989. Yeah, pardon? (student speaking faintly) There are no sections in this course. This is why we have an hour and a quarter lecture rather than a 50-minute lecture. Yeah. (student speaking faintly) The topics for the papers will be posted two weeks before the papers are due and we will give, I should say a couple of things about that. This is not a research course so you can write a first-rate paper based on reading the material on this syllabus. You are not expected to go beyond the syllabus. And we will post, two weeks before the papers are due, a list of topics of and it will be, there will be very significant amount of choice on it so we'll probably give you four or five possible topics to write about. Yes, sir. What is the expectation for graduate students? The same course requirements, two papers and a final exam. Yeah. Yes, sir. Pardon. - [Student] Is there a limit for (mumbles) students to join the class? - No, there's no limit. This is an uncapped course. I'm hoping we can stay in this room, it looks like it. Numbers tend to go down rather than up during shopping period. It's not a capped course. Yeah. (student speaking faintly) People have taken courses with me before know that I have a pretty interactive lecturing style. So yes, there will be microphones and there will be questions. I'm not planning to talk for an hour and a quarter every Tuesday and Thursday. So there will be significant amount of interaction. Yes sir. (student speaking faintly) Yeah, we currently, I believe, have six in addition to Christina's Teaching Fellows, all of whom will be holding office hours. They'll be available and you will be able to go and talk to them about what's come up in the class, about your papers and so on. And the conversations you have with those teaching fellows, we will also address then in the videotaped office hours that we post. Okay. So any other questions, comments, reactions? So on Tuesday, we're gonna talk about the collapse of the Soviet Union from Soviet Communism to Russian gangster capitalism. I will see you then. (music)
Good evening and welcome my name is Rick Mulaney I'm the director of the Public Policy Institute here at Jacksonville University and welcome to the fourth annual Hesburgh lecture we're very pleased to have all of you here the Public Policy Institute in partnership with the Notre Dame Club of Greater Jacksonville has been hosting this lecture series for four years and we are very pleased to here at Jacksonville University and I will tell you in the past we've had some outstanding lectures but quite frankly I think tonight's will be the best yet and it is certainly the most timely as everyone knows the President Barack Obama was here in Jacksonville today the Republican nominee for president Donald Trump was in Jacksonville today and on Tuesday five days from now there'll be an election in which the ballot the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance very important topic and that's the one we have for tonight it's a great topic and hope you're going to enjoy tonight's discussion before we get to that discussion this lecture series wouldn't exist except for Pacquiao bein as y'all if you know he's the president of the Notre Dame Club of Greater Jacksonville and so Pat came together and we put together this lecture series we think it's a great a great annual event and it just so happens when he was in law school at Notre Dame he had professor Barrett as his teacher so not only see the president of the club the person responsible for putting this together he was a student in her class he is the perfect person to introduce our tonight's special speaker so I'd like to introduce Pat Kilbane it is it's always fun to do an introduction when you don't even need a paper or notes to introduce the person but you I want to make sure I don't leave anything out but and it's really fun to see professor Barrett when a three-hour exam is not gonna follow my visit with her so professor amy coney barrett is the diane and mo miller research chair and law she received her undergraduate degree from Rhodes College in Memphis Tennessee where she received that degree magna laude in English literature and then she received her Juris Doctorate degree from the University of Notre Dame summa laude where she won the horns prize and to translate that that means that she was the top graduate in her class and going from Notre Dame she went to clerk for justice Lauren Silverman on the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and then that she chased that with clerking for the late Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court Antonin Scalia following her work with Justice Scalia she worked at the Miller Cassady law firm in Washington DC where she had a litigation practice at the trial and appellate level she did appellate work also professor Barrett's scholarship focuses on statutory interpretation constitutional law federal courts and in fact she was appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts of the United States Supreme Court to the Advisory Committee for the federal rules of appellate procedure she's she's one of those professors I actually had her for two classes she doesn't remember I had to remind her when we were setting this up but she she's she's that professor who's elected year after year by her students to give the commencement addresses to be the who receives the award for being the outstanding professor so it's it's truly a blessing to have her here especially as Rick said during this timely season where one of the major issues for many voters especially me is which one of these candidates is going to get to appoint Supreme Court justices so I can't wait to hear her take on that and lastly professor Barrett makes her home with her Notre Dame Ella's alum husband Jesse in South Bend with their seven children so professor Barrett welcome to Jacksonville a little bit about Justice Scalia and what his absence from the court will mean and then shift and talk in a broader brush about what's coming for the court and what the election will mean for the court and I know I have a room that's mixed some lawyers and some not so if the lawyers will forgive me out I'm going to try to pitch it so that the non lawyer can follow along as well justice scalia's it's hard to overstate the influence that he had on the court and the whole that will be gone with his passing yes Justice Scalia was a conservative and so you know it's often said he was on the conservative wing of the court but it I really dislike the use of that word in this context and he would too translated to say that he was a conservative doesn't refer to partisan politics to say in the context of constitutional law that Justice Scalia was a conservative described his approach to the Constitution and has approached to the judicial rule not a party affiliation Justice Scalia's approach to interpretation of both the Constitution and statutes and that's the grist for the mill for a federal judge as interpreting federal statutes and the Constitution his approach very much emphasized the primacy of the text his view was that you're talking about the Constitution as a text that the Constitution means what it meant to those who ratified it as people would have under he interpreted the text as people would have understood that text at the time it was ratified so for the original Constitution we're looking at the late 18th century understandings for the Civil Rights amendments we're looking at the post Civil War Reconstruction period understandings but his rationale for that was depth democracy that this is the enacted text it went through the process of ratification or a constitutional amendment to become a law and if we change the law now to comport with our current understandings or what we wanted to mean then it sees to be the law that has democratic legitimacy so he believed that change should come from the democratic process that changed from the Constitution should come through constitutional amendment and statutory change should come from Congress or state legislatures that the Constitution didn't call all the shots that change and social change the Constitution set a floor below which we can't go but that above that floor there's a lot of room for democracy for the people to add additional protections and to make changes so Justice Scalia resisted the notion that the Supreme Court should be in the business of imposing its views of social mores on the American people he thought that things that the Constitution didn't declare off limits were up to the people to decide his view of this emphasis on text and the emphasis on textual meaning as it was understood at the time of its ratification in the context of the Constitution or statutory enactment in the context of legislation distinguish him from those we might characterize as the Liberals on the court and I give the same caveat here we're not talking about partisan politics we're talking about the word liberal capturing an approach to constitutional interpretation and that approach which Justice Breyer Justice Stephen Breyer is a good example of it Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer went out on the talking circuit and they often sparred about the approaches to constitutional interpretation so justice Breyers approach is much more pragmatic so he starts with the text of a statute or a constitutional provision he begins with the text but as Justice Breyer describes it the text is a starting point but not an ending point and sometimes it makes sense to push the text in a different direction in a way that makes sense to the judge that the judge will think leads to a more sensible result so that's kind of a nutshell version of the living Constitution approach and it stands in Contra distinction to the original ISM or textualism of Justice Scalia Justice Scalia was an extraordinarily effective advocate for his approach to interpretation because he was very smart and had an outsized personality he really was brilliant it was intimidating working for him you know when he called you in his office you had to be prepared to just go to the mat and talk about whatever it was and he was always five steps ahead of you so he had a intellect but then he didn't express that intellect only to lawyers it wasn't just in the United States reports and judicial opinions he wrote books that were accessible to popular audiences he went out and gave speeches and so he made his ideas and his approach to the constitution and his ideas about the judicial role accessible to non lawyers he wants remarks that the reason why he wrote dissents and separate opinions concurrences is because he wanted to get them in the case books and he was a colorful writer he was an excellent writer and so casebook authors would include his dissents and separate opinions because they were so engaging and so clear and then that influenced law students who read them so his influence on generations of law students has been great and his influence on the public debate has been great so the significance of his seat it's it's an empty seat on the court and it has the potential to flip the balance on the court between these two camps of judges judges who take a more expansive approach to Constitution and judges who take a more textual approach to the Constitution but the symbolic significance is that it's his seat so he is the face really and he is the face of this originalist text analyst textualist approach to the Constitution and so if President Obama had successfully and I think at this point it's unlikely that President Obama will be the one to name the successor to Scalia's seat but if Hillary Clinton or President Obama names the successor to that seat it's not just that it was held by a conservative justice one who took this more conservative approach to the judicial role but that it was Justice Scalia so the symbolic nature of that flip would be significant I want to talk a little bit more broadly about what the election means for the composition of the court more generally Justice Scalia's seat is getting all the attention because it's the one that stands vacant but the reality is that the next president will likely get four appointments Justice Scalia's seat is empty Justice Ginsburg is 83 Justice Breyer Rick help Maisie 79 78 78 and Who am I Oh Justice Kennedy is 80 so that's four seats that's the last president who got four nominations was Nixon so this could be a sea change now you're talking about Justice Scalia who took this very kind of rigorous textual approach Justice Kennedy is a fellow traveler of the courts textualist in statutory cases not always in constitutional cases he's obviously the notorious swing vote in constitutional cases but he's a he's a swing vote he can go either way Ginsburg and Breyer are much more firmly in the camp of the more expansive approach to constitutional interpretation so let's imagine President Clinton if she replaces Ginsburg and Breyer she will do so with much much much younger justices who then will likely have a very long tenure in the court in front of them okay that will be quite significant to the court if she replaces Justice Kennedy with a pick it's going to be someone who I mean Justice Kennedy is a swing vote sometimes he votes with a more conservative wing of the court sometimes with the more liberal wing of the court and again I'm using those turns and they're sent in their interpretive sense rather than their partisan sense um but Hillary Clinton would not appoint someone who would be a swing in those cases it would be someone who was always very firmly on the side of those who interpret the Constitution more expansively so we would be talking aver about a very market shift it would be a very Court that was very very liberal and took a very expansive view of the judicial role what would we have in a trump court who knows I think we know for sure I could say with confidence I don't know who Hillary Clinton would appoint but I can say with confidence the profile or the kind of constitutional approach she would want Trump I'm not so sure he's offered a list in his list is populated with people who would take a more Scalia esque approach to the Constitution who knows if he would choose from that list or not is obviously not bound to do so I think it would be maybe more of a mixed bag I think maybe Trump would appoint some that were more in the mold of Scalia maybe some more in the mold of Kennedy who knows I think we may well end up with a moderate to more conservative court on judicial role I think it is safe to say it probably wouldn't be as hard to the the left-leaning side on the approach to constitutional questions as as Hillary would before Rick and I start you know the next segment the final thing I want to say about this this question of partisan politics and the court is that Justice Scalia thought it was so important and if voters could really absorb it's hard because voters and people generally see the headlines in newspapers you know court decides in favor of same-sex marriage or you know court strikes down Texas abortion restrictions it's just the headline it's just the bottom line it doesn't show any of the reasoning and the hard analysis that the court goes through to reach that decision and I think it leaves voters with the impression that justices and judges are just casting votes based on the policy results that they prefer you know I'm I'm pro-life or I'm Pro same-sex marriage or what-have-you whatever the the hot issue is on the court that term but that is not how judges see their role it is certainly not how Justice Scalia saw his and one there are a couple of really stark examples of this that I think show in Justice Scalia's case the divergence between partisan politics or political preferences and adherence to the rule of law and to me that's the quality that we should be looking at when we think about what justices would fill these vacant and soon-to-be vacant spots on the court Justice Scalia before he was on the court was in the Reagan administration he was in he was a in a law-and-order Republican administration that was tough on crime and as you know in his former life as a Republican and the department of jennife Ischl in the republican department of justice i'm assuming that his personal preferences may have leaned more to the law-and-order side but he was one of the most consistently Pro criminal defendant justices in constitutional Criminal Procedure cases because he thought the text of the Constitution required it and so he was constantly voting with the quote kind of more liberal justices in cases interpreting the sixth amendments right to confront witnesses in interpreting the Fourth Amendment search and seizure Clause interpreting the extent of the jury trial right and sentencing because he thought you went where the law took you you followed the rule of law not your partisan preference an example that was close to his heart was Texas versus Johnson which was a flag burning case Justice Scalia um and I I think I heard someone describe this once as something that would be difficult for someone not in his generation to fully understand the gravity of it I'm Texas versus Johnson involved a case challenging state law Texas law that made it illegal to desecrate the flag many states had such laws and you know Johnson in this case had desecrated the flag Justice Scalia voted with those justices who hold that he had a First Amendment right of free speech to desecrate the flag that was very painful for Justice Scalia and and to me not that I would desecrate the flag but I think not what I've what my grandfather said who was a World War 2 veteran was that you just can't understand the deep significance of the pain that it wasn't just wow I don't like that result but kind of the emotional wrenching that it was to cast a vote for a result that he really found painful that he abhorred but he thought that's what the First Amendment required and I think those examples really show what we want an injustice someone who applies the law who follows the law where it goes and doesn't decide simply on the basis of partisan preference Rick I know you had some questions that you wanted to present presser Barrett I like to put this a little bit of a historical context we had a chance to trap to talk yesterday and we'll talk a little bit about the arc of history because something you said yesterday was really striking I want to put with five days the next five days what happens on Tuesday means to the future of the country in the future of these decisions not by looking for just yet but by looking backward one of the things you said I'd like for you to comment on yesterday was that the last time there was a liberal majority was during the Nixon administration so can we look back a little bit over the last sort of 40 years and sort of describe the composition of the court and then describe what's at stake next Tuesday sure um Nixon got four appointments now it's a little bit so a lot of people say well the last president who could really shape you know the last time we had a majority of Democratic appointees on the court was prior to Nixon okay which is true Nixon had four pointees it's a little bit difficult to say because and this has been particularly two of Republican appointed justices they haven't always turned out to take a conservative approach or take kind of a very text-based approach to the Constitution right so included in justice Stevens was a Ford appointee but he was a Republican appointee but he was very much in the camp of the the more expansive judicial role type judges Blackmun Nixon appointee so he was a Republican appointee justice Souter was a you know George HW Bush appointee but timed his resignation so that President Obama would get the appointment because justice Souter was also very much more kind of an expansive judicial role so it's it's not always easy to say do we have a primarily conservative or liberal Court simply by looking at who whether the majority of the sitting justices were appointed by Republicans or Democrats I think that with the Nixon appointments there was definitely a move in the court and Carter didn't get any and then when you see Reagan come in that's where you had the real definitive shift that's where you got justice O'Connor Justice Kennedy Justice Scalia you had a conservative majority you had an active and energized conservative majority on the court Justice Thomas was then appointed by George HW Bush and justice Souter that was you know Justice Scalia one on the court in 1986 so I think in those years before Rehnquist was appointed by Ford and that was also kind of a push towards the more restrictive judicial role type Court but you really had it kind of decisively accomplished in the Reagan years so you're looking for 1986 to the present that that's at least we're talking to a pretty healthy stretcher we're looking at least 20 years I think it's also important to recognize that part of what Nixon was getting at Nixon promised to appoint strict constructionists you know judges that would really enforce the Constitution as written and by the way Justice Scalia would roll over in his grave if he heard anyone describe him as a strict constructionist because his view was that you know an interpret the text strictly you don't interpret it expansively ughter prett it at the level of generality with which it is written but strict constructionism was a term that got thrown around a lot because it was a reaction to the Warren Court so the Warren Court had been very active it had really been V living constitutionalism Court before that this idea of a living Constitution really wasn't around and so when Nixon came in and said he wanted to change the court it was in response to what a lot of people saw at the time as a court run amok that the Warren Court was inventing all of these rights in broad terms some come in some commentators talked about sort of the arc of the court that from the FDR and Harry Truman yeah but it certainly was liberal for many decades that a transition started with President Nixon and as you've mentioned for probably at least three decades going back to 1986 and maybe beyond you've pretty much had more or less that you could say a conservative majority is that a fair state I'd like to talk about what's happening next Tuesday you mentioned earlier something that I think is really true I mean I the focus of the nation tends to be on the replacement of Scalia because that's the 5-4 tiebreaker but what's being missed as you mentioned I'd like you to comment on the most two things not only the ages of the three older justices Ginsburg Kennedy and Breyer but how youthful the more liberal judges are Kagan at 56 and Sotomayor at 62 meaning that isn't it very possible you could have a liberal majority for the next couple decades and Beyond based on what happens next Tuesday absolutely and I mean I think that I think one reason so there's a lot of speculation and I don't have a crystal ball so I don't know if Hillary Clinton wins whether she would stay with Merrick garland or choose someone else but I suspect she would choose someone else for youth because a president can shape the court Merrick garland is in his 60s 61 62 I think in his early 60s a president has a bigger impact on the court the longer the justice he or she appoints stays in office and Merrick garland I think I read an analysis by a former Supreme Court Clerk who's a Democratic policy adviser he said oh no no no no she should just focus on getting through controversial legislation in Congress and not fight the garland nomination battle because he will do everything she wants him to do he will be solidly reliable in every high-stakes constitutional case because he would take this approach that the Constitution should translate into kind of Prudential judgments by justices I don't know if she would or not because even if Merrick garland who is by all accounts a wonderful man and an excellent judge even if he would be reliable and shares her judicial shares her judicial philosophy and a lot of these high-stakes questions he doesn't excite many parts of the base he's he's a little boring in that respect so she would have an opportunity to energize her base and to put in someone who is much younger and then absolutely Rick you have a pretty long living court you know Justice Scalia was on the court for almost 30 years and he was appointed in his early 50s so it could represent a significant change over the last several decades and to give that a little bit of meaning what I'd like to do is is to ask you a question that arises from the third presidential debate Chris Wallace asked this question which I think relates to how you select judges and what it might mean in the third presidential debate you may remember Chris Wallace asks each candidate what criteria are you looking for when you go to pick the next Justice I'm giving you a real shorthand of a couple of the answers Hillary Clinton mentioned she wanted someone who protected individual rights and minority rights Donald Trump mentioned he wanted somebody pro-life either of these court of course a very Scalia like and so I'd like you to comment on that versus the selection criteria based on your views of constitutional law professor as to what we're looking for in the US Supreme Court justice um those kinds of answers are I think what's wrong with our nomination process to say I want to appoint someone who's pro-life or I want to appoint someone whose primary focus is protecting minority rights though the candidates are talking to their bases and talking to the electric and saying signal I'm going to put people on the court who share your policy preferences was saying before I think that's not the right qualification for a justice I mean we shouldn't be putting people on the court that share our policy preferences we should be putting people on the court who want to apply the Constitution and by the way on the on the individual rights of the minority rights when the Constitution demands that minority rights be protected that's what we want justices to do that's their job I tell I you x' the example with my constitutional law students of Odysseus words resisting the sirens but the Constitution is like in Odysseus ties himself to the mass to resist the song of the sirens he tells his crew don't untie me no matter how much I plead that's what we've done as the American people with the Constitution we've said you know it's the people sober appealing to the people drunk that when you are tempted to get carried away with by your passions and trample upon the First Amendment rights or minority rights this document will hold you back and it's the job of the justices of judges generally but then ultimately the Supreme Court for the exercise of judicial review to tell us like in the flag-burning case we understand you people you American citizens that you want to protect your flag but you've made a more fundamental commitment to free speech that ties your hands and you can't do so that's what it's about it's not about I like flag desecration I don't like flag desecration it's about are you going to enforce the limits that are there but then if the people do something you don't like if it's not one of those situations where the the hands are tied or just yes it's tied to the mast that you have the courage and integrity to say I'm not going to interfere in the democratic process if the Constitution doesn't restrict your ability to do electorate what you've decided to do in this particular statute you've enacted then I'm going to not interfere I will resist the temptation as a judge to impose my preferences on you and say that you are limited in the policies that you want to pursue this is an aside Justice Roberts in his confirmation you talked about the role of being an umpire and I guess if you were an umpire you couldn't be pulling for the Cubs or the or the Indians last night you just had to call it ball or a strike regardless of your policy preference as to how that game turned out but I would like to bring up a case that illustrates the difference of a more expansive view versus a a textual view I almost said strict construction excuse me more originalist view and this is a case and this is not about the merits of the policy so I want to lay aside whether or not you're in favor of same-sex marriage or opposed to same-sex marriage but I would like to talk about a burger fell versus Hodges a 5-4 decision that was based largely on the Due Process Clause of the 14th amendment and in particular this notion of substantive due process and a fundamental right in substantive due process and could you sort of explain and contrast the view of the majority versus the view of the minority and what that might mean not what only men have been for that case but what it might mean for future cases sure the Due Process Clause of the 14th amendment is the relevant phrase here is pretty brief it says no one shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law and that it's from that phrase that we get this doctor and that Ric is referring to called substantive due process the idea is that this this phrase this vague phrase contains within a protection for certain substantive rights so it is that portion of the Due Process Clause that the court has relied upon in finding a right to abortion for example so in locating rights within that phrase and the equal protection clause is also relevant here as well that no state shall deny to anyone any person equal protection of the laws the court that is a particularly controversial area that substantive due process area because it is an area in which the court that the in which the court says for itself what it thinks those rights are based on what it thinks contemporary values are at the time so Justice Scalia was now a fan of substantive due process because he felt like listen it says no one shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law that's a procedural guarantee about what happens to you before your property or your life is taken away for example that it doesn't contain a substantive guarantee saying that you know the state has to provide you certain guarantees or the state through legislation can't do certain things so on obergefell and this is the New York Times headline problem I think is that case got reported and as I heard my students even talk about it even in law school even after they'd become kind of acculturated to some of these things people were presenting it as a vote on the court for or against same-sex marriage but that's a that's not what the opinion was about what the opinion was about was who gets to decide whether we have same-sex marriage or not with the majority saying that it was a right guaranteed by the Constitution and so therefore states were not free and I mean that Odysseus tying himself to the mass sense that states weren't free to say that marriage had to be between a man and a woman and the dissenters weren't taking a view in fact Chief Justice Roberts dissent was very explicit about that he said you know those who want same-sex marriage you know you have every right to to lobby and state legislatures to make that happen but the dissents view was that it wasn't for the court to decide that the Constitution didn't speak to the question and so that it was a change that should occur through the legislative process and indeed many states were already moving in that direction and making legislative changes so I think obergefell and and what we're talking about for the future of the court it's really a who decides question people often ask and Rick and I talked about a little bit a little bit about this yesterday well in what cases might we expect to see this controversy of who decides when would it matter if if flurry Clinton wins one example would be that the court in a case when justice rehnquist was the chief decided that there was not a constitutional right to die and it reached that decision it was a substantive due process case interpreting this phrase no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law but the methodology that the court adopted there said okay we will recognize that there is maybe some substantive component to that guarantee so we'll recognize something about substantive due process doctrine but we will only recognize a right as one that's protected by the Constitution by substantive due process I'm not talking about the First Amendment Fourth Amendment and all that I'm just talking about the abstract rights that the court has found in that substantive due process doctrine the court said we will only find such a right if there has been a long tradition in America see where the winds are blowing right now in society we will look at American history and American traditions and say yes this is a right for example early substance of due process cases dealt with the right of parents to educate their children that would be a right where the court could see you know that sort of firmly rooted history with the right to die the court said there has been no long-standing tradition in America of protecting a right to die and so we will not recognize that right I could imagine that case coming out differently and that precedent being overruled if Hillary Clinton is president because as we all know there's a big push now and I mean we see this and other countries we see it in Canada we see it in different European countries we've seen a big press for it in the United States a press for a right to die and I think that's going to be an issue when when legislative change is slow because people increasingly see the court as a political institution when they can't accomplish things in the legislature they try to litigate it and then declare a fast Rin through the court because I think it's faster to get it through the justices than to convince their citizens and citizens in the legislative process so that's an example where the methodology of who decides matter you know if we're going to have assisted suicide if we're gonna have right to die some states have already gone that route the question is is that something that people decide on a state-by-state basis or does the Supreme Court impose a national rule that tells some states you're not free to make it illegal to commit suicide that's really well put I can tell you in in our public policy class I tell you our students we're having this conversation right now and and the example you gave on right-to-die is a real-life one one of my own and I admit that a lot of people may disagree with this position but one of the reasons I personally get concerned about not tying substantive due process to history and tradition is that then policymaking to me can become very unfettered based on just whatever you happen to think for example in the future and this is more hypothetical but I could see it happening the case comes before the court in the future and it's a substantive due process case and what is you get five unelected lawyers who disagree with four unelected lawyers and it could be is there a fundamental right to health care is there a fundamental right to a living wage is there a fundamental right to housing and in our class we talk about this these may all be terrific public policies and maybe Congress should pass a statute or maybe the president should go to Congress but the question that you raised earlier is a really big one and that it to me is that who sets policy for the country and does judicial and the effect of judicial philosophy on setting that policy so can you can you comment on how you see that may be impacting real-life cases beyond right-to-die yeah um I think let's see so sub I I think there are a number of areas I can just tick off a couple quickly in constitutional law where that who decides issue would be big and I actually think there's some in the statutory context that would matter a lot as well I think the death penalty is likely you know the court the court has had an uneasy relationship with the death penalty for a long time it came very close to holding the death penalty constitutional in the set in the late 70s early 80s and then as the court came back the states states that one of the death penalty really pushed back and then the court retreated I think there's a question of who decides there is that a state decision is that a constitutional decision I think right to die I think abortion I think people phrase the abortion question when they think about the Supreme Court as is Roe versus Wade gonna be overruled well versus way it actually isn't the law it was superseded by Casey versus Planned Parenthood but we've had you know 30 plus years of a court that did take you know on the whole a more conservative approach to the judicial role in Roe versus Wade Casey versus Pennsylvania left Roe largely intact reinstated a new test but still there I don't think that abortion or the right to abortion is would change some of the restrictions but I think some of the restrictions would change I think that's what we just saw last term in the case out of Texas states you know after the Kermit Gosnell affair and all of that states have imposed regulations on abortion clinics and I think the question is how much freedom the court is willing to let States have in regulating abortion I think the question of you know the court has held that in some circumstances states can render partial-birth abortion illegal very late term abortions I think that's the kind of thing that would change I don't think that the core case that grows core holding that you know women have a right to an abortion I don't think that would change but I think the question of whether people can get very late term abortions you know how many restrictions can be put on clinics I think that would change I think another area which people often overlook is statutory justice scalia cared a lot about statutory interpretation and this idea it's similar to his idea it was of a piece of his view of the Constitution which is that when Congress enacts a statute the words matter you interpret the words as they're written and if Congress made a mistake I mean I'm not talking about you know a scriveners error but if Congress didn't anticipate everything that would unfold you know if the circumstances change the judge doesn't have license to change the statute that is a who decides question that it falls back to Congress I think a lot of the cases that we're going to see coming to the court now are involved statutory interpretation the court just took up that transgender bathroom case from North Carolina that's a statutory question that's a question involving the interpretation of title 9 which prohibits educational institutions that receive federal money which you know all almost all of them do from the Department of Education from discriminating on the basis of sex and the Department of Education and the Department of Justice you interpreted that phrase and telling North Carolina in that case that it had to permit physiological of someone who is physiologically a boy but identifying as a girl to use the girls bathroom that is a huge shift right and this is why it's made the news that would be a big shift and it's a shift from the prior interpretations of that statute which said separating locker rooms and showers and bathrooms on the basis of gender were okay that's a big shift and it's a who decides questions so that's pending on the court and and you know there are a lot of reasons why might one might say that's a public policy debate people will feel passionately on either side about whether physiological males who identify as female should be permitted in bathrooms especially with our young girls present and we've seen all these debates it's a coup decides question when title 9 was enacted it's pretty clear that no one including the Congress that enacted that statute would have dreamed of that result at that time maybe things have changed so that we should change title 9 maybe you know those arguing in favor of this kind of transgender bathroom access are right that's a policy debate to have but it does seem to strain the text of the statute to say that title nine demands it so is that the kind of thing that the court should interpret the statute to kind of update it to pick sides in this public policy debate or should we go to our Congress should we go to our legislators and say if this is the policy that we want to have now now we have new recognition of the rights of transgender people and we want to shift the policy is that kind of see change the sort of thing that should come legislatively or from the court and I think we're going to continue to see cases like that there's another case pending about doctors I don't know if you follow this Peter there's a lawsuit that's been filed because HHS relying on that same language in title 9 has now interpreted the Affordable Care Act to require doctors to provide transitional surgeries and not discriminate if doctors and hospitals including Catholic hospitals receive federal funds which they all do because of Medicaid so do we have some questions from the audience I was asked early can we just maybe read them or do you have some actually give the microphone to some people for some of the people sure sure I will we have some questions from the audience do you have a question Richard go ahead microphone we've talked about all these cases on the due process but there are other you know amendments that are you know that are you know you have the whole concept of starry decisis and out how do you view the court role in things like the First Amendment case you have the you know the Citizens United which you know both sides are arguing right politically not legally and you know I guess it's a hell are case in DC about the guns so you have all these different amendments right which are far from the 14th but they they have settled reasonably settled law and we're we're how does that liberal conservative apply in those kind of cases which are relatively settled well citizens united in Heller are both fairly recent so I think the court started as Isis the court is always at pains to say that star decisis is a matter of policy not an extra Bowl command is the language that it uses so while the court star decisis is the principle that the court will generally not disturb the cases that it's already decided unless it has some good reason for doing so and I think that citizens united and Heller would both be vulnerable if if Hillary Clinton wins because they are cases which you know in which the dissenters in those cases who will still be on the court at those cases are revisited felt passionately that the court got it wrong and that is one of the factors that the court considers and whether to abandon a prior case the reality is that Heller because Heller protected the right to have handgun in the home but it didn't say that there couldn't be other restrictions on guns and the court has been giving a lot of leeway to restricting guns I don't actually know if there would be as much interest in getting rid of Heller in particular because most gun restrictions are still standing but Citizens United I thought would be a pretty easy target professor raised a really interesting question on this statutory construction issue I think many people including myself tend to think so much about the Constitution itself that is there a liberal or conservative approach to statutory construction and one good case I think to maybe touch on briefly would be King versus Burwell a good example that is not a death penalty or social issue case but healthcare you remember there were two big challenges to the Affordable Care Act the first one in National Federation and the second one on statutory construction and clearly wasn't there a liberal and conservative divide and how to determine whether or not there is a federal or state exchange can we come in on that but also in the sense of what this might mean how a how a court of one persuasion of the other can have such a profound public policy effect sure so King versus Burwell was the second challenge to the affordable care act and it was a statutory challenge not a constitutional challenge basically the statute the affordable care act provided sir subsidies that the tax subsidies the language of the statute said that you got them when you purchase your insurance on an exchange established by the state and state was defined in the statute to include the 50 states in the District of Columbia it distinguished even between states and territories Congress when it enacted the statute anticipated because of the Medicaid pressure the Medicaid deal in the statute that all stat all states would adopt exchanges but then as we know the end of that story many states resisted adopting exchanges so the government the federal government had to set up some exchanges and then the question was well gosh the people who have purchased their health insurance from the federal exchanges federal exchange wouldn't qualify for the tax subsidy and that could have a disastrous effect on the statute Justice Scalia like the text of the text list approach was okay well maybe Congress didn't accurately foresee what was going to happen Congress doesn't have perfect foresight or maybe Congress wanted this to be part of the pressure Congress didn't really want a federal exchange because it looked too much like a single-payer system so maybe this was an unseen bargain maybe what they wanted to do is pressure states to take the exchange that the fact that their citizens wouldn't get the subsidy if they had to go to a federal exchange would have been some pressure creating and putting pressure on the states to actually set these exchanges so Justice Scalia basically said well this is what the statute says and now that events have unfolded so that it seems like this isn't this is going to have some bad effects for the Affordable Care Act we can't go back and change what the statute says but the other justices disagree kind of a pretty good example of the difference in construction between the two did you have a question in the in the first affordable care act case yes the this yeah National Federation of Independent businesses there was a heavy statutory construction and component to that case to because this is not a tax right the individual mandate but the court in an effort and the court and a good way tries to avoid constitutional questions but the the controversy in that particular case was that to avoid the Constitution they very creatively interpreted the statute to be a tax question from Eric Smith Amy we have a question in the back from mr. Smith thank you how awesome it is to have a professor here from Notre Dame that worked with the Great Justice Scalia and thank you Rick and the Public Policy Institute for having her here and making this possible I was an elected official here for 25 years and arguably the poster child for term limits but I want to ask this question I and that's a wonderful law students when I was a professor and and we got the impression and working working with the cases from Justice Scalia that he held people like me legislators Congress congressman in in low esteem could you just disprove that and it's it's okay if you don't but he didn't seem to have whole congressmen and legislators in the highest esteem that's my question thank you so much Wow um let's see he was not a fan of legislative history to be sure so he often took aim at legislative history I never heard him disparage legislators at all I mean I think that he did sometimes question a number of the courts doctrines call for giving deference to the constitutional judgments made by legislatures and I do know that towards the end of the lot towards the end of his life he had expressed scepticism that many members of Congress spent much time contemplating the Constitution and whether statute was constitutional before they enacted it I don't know that he had I mean he had great respect for the democratic process so I think the the logical conclusion of that to me would be that he also had great respect for those who represented us in the democratic process press appear to have one last question and I'm gonna ask you for some closing comments if you would here's the last question actually is it asked you to look a little bit into your crystal ball in one of the presidential debates the two candidates were asked about appointment of justices and what their concerns were for the future what their priorities were Hillary Clinton talked about abortion and citizens united Donald Trump talked about gun rights and Heller and there's a tendency of course to look at those social issues in particular with a lot of emotion but beyond those cases looking to 217 and beyond what are some of the significant matters that you think will come before the court and where the composition of the court could matter to the outcome sure um I think right to die I said we've touched on some of them already I think the statutory cases will be big I think these title 9 interpretation cases I think religious exemptions are gonna be really big I think you know that was the Hobby Lobby case that Notre Dame was and the Little Sisters of the Poor were among the religious institutions challenging the application of the contraceptive mandate California as a state has mandated that all ensured all employers and insurers provide coverage for elective abortions and they can do that as a state because the the only thing that the only basis for that challenge at the federal level was the Religious Freedom Restoration Act we're going to continue to see those challenges there's been a conscience exemption to doctors for performing procedures abortions or some of these you know transitional changes performing mastectomy x' on women who wanted to transition to men there's been a conscience for doctors to this point this lawsuit I was mentioning challenges that that's that's being kind of dialed back so I think on all of these things these are kind of hot and heavy matters of public debate that we disagree about you know that citizens are trying to persuade each other one way and another and I think the question of who decides those questions whether they're left to the electorate or whether the court and administrators decide them is big those are some great comments you've kind of you've kind of gone to my last which is we're out of time for tonight but I wanted to ask if you had any given this historic point that we're at I think the people this room would all agree this is a unique and historic time that the election on Tuesday will be very consequential people are talking about a lot of areas but particularly for the people in this room in terms of the court and the direction of the court and issues will be decided you have any comments as a constitutional law scholar and professor and maybe clerked for Justice Scalia's to your thoughts about the future of the court and where we're heading gosh it is a consequential moment and the who decides question just as a personal matter is really important to me and so I guess I I worry a lot you know about the who decides question about our decisions you know and my voice is kind of getting taken away depending on on what happens and and and that could be true you know and either candidates selection of nominees but that I think is the question for me well I on behalf of the Public Policy Institute I have a little special presentiment I hope all of you will agree with me that this has been a terrific evening with Professor bhaer would you all agree and we have two gifts for you it's so nice not to be in government anymore where I can do this this is one that will remind you of our Public Policy Institute and this is something that we hope you just find this nice but I will say I hope all of you had agreed that this forced Hesburgh lecture was a very good one I hope you've enjoyed the last hour don't forget to vote thank you all very very much. 
In the last section, we finished by talking about individuals who had major impacts in learning. In this section, we begin talking about schools of psychology and the major players that made psychology what it is today. We begin by starting with slide two. The first group that we shall start talking about is the Structuralists. The Structuralists were one of the first groups as a particular school that studied psychology, and there are a couple of major players in this group. The first individual was Wundt, who is considered to be the first psychologist, and a true psychologist that we have today. Titchener was one of his students and he’s considered to be the first United States psychologist. The Structuralists were the first real school or group of psychologists. These individuals were impressed by what was going on in the physical sciences, such as chemistry and biology. Especially chemistry; where people were breaking down complex things into simple things. The classic example is what we talked about last time, molecules to atoms. The Structuralists thought they could do the same kind of thing with mental thoughts. The main idea was to basically try to figure out what was going on in someone’s head. To do that, we needed to think about what was the smallest subjective unit that was out there. For the Structuralists, as we see in slide three, these were the elementary elements of consciousness. Now, how do you get at these elementary elements of consciousness say the Structuralists? Well, what we have to do is kind of sit down and think and use what they called introspection. Basically what you would do is train an observer to reflect on and analyze a particular mental experience. It required someone who was very highly trained. This individual would sit down and basically think of a concept. The classic example would be a table, and as we see in slide four, that person would take the table and break it down into its basic elements. So it would include things such as the legs, the top, the back, etc. Then, what you would do is go to the next concept. That next concept might be the legs. So you would take the legs and you would break that down. It would long and cylindrical, it may be made of wood and on and on and on. Until ultimately you would get down to the very underlying basic concepts of what that leg, was. And so, you would go all the way back to the basic start of a concept. Now for the Structuralists, as we see in slide five, there were some things that were extremely important. Number one, experience was extremely important with a concept. If you have no experience with some kind of particular concept, it’s very difficult to break it down. Number two, the mind is passive. That is, when one thought comes, it is followed by another thought, and on and on and on. As we can see here, this is the classic model of Associationism that we talked about in earlier sections. Number three, the structuralists believed that you could break down complex thoughts into very simple thoughts and study these. In essence, each thought was the sum of the other thoughts. That is, all the other thoughts that you had in your system. Finally they were empiricists. That is, they gathered information by observation and recording. Now what was the problem with the Structuralist school? The classic thing that we see here is starting on slide six. Let’s take the concept of love. What I’d like you to do is stop the slide here for a minute and break down the concept of love. What is love? Break it down into its elementary elements. After you do that, then restart the material. Well, a lot of people put down lots of different things for love. For example, they might put down intimacy, sex and lots and lots of other things such as caring, compassion and all these kinds of things. However, another group might put down a couple of those and put down other things, such as relationships, and children and on and on and on. And I’ll always put down that there are three main concepts of love. That is, sex, drugs and rock and roll. Ok, so which of those groups is right? What we would have, then, is a conference, we would have nine or ten different groups from nine or ten different labs all coming together. We would then have this debate about which concept of love was right. People would say, well, my concepts are better than your concepts and on and on. So the first problem is with the Structuralist’s model is that it had no reliability. That is, you should get the same results over and over and over again. That is, one lab should get the same kind of results as another lab. That did not happen in the Structuralist school. As a consequence, it really couldn’t test what it was supposed to be testing, so it had no validity as well. And as a result of these problems (and others), it received a lot of major criticism. 
The first major group that that criticized the Structuralists is shown in slide seven. This is the second school of psychology and is called the Gestalt School. There are three major players in the Gestalt School, and this is not the same Gestalt psychology that we talk about in later times in more of the clinical area. The three major players in the Gestalt School were Kohler, Werner, Kofka and Wertheimer. This school developed as a reaction to the Structuralists and also the Behaviorists which we’ll talk about a little bit later. They disagreed with the Structuralists that complex thoughts could be broken down into simple thoughts, and they also disagreed with the behaviorists that complex behavior could be broken down into simple behavior. The problem with the Structuralists contend the Gestalt school proponents is this. When you break down the elementary elements of consciousness or break down elementary behaviors into its very small units, you take out the meaning. So for the Gestaltists, the saying developed, “The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. ” In addition, and as we see here on slide nine, the Gestaltists said you needed Naïve Observers: that is, people who were not trained. What the Gestalt group ended up trying to do was explain perception. Consequently, they developed lots of major and clever experiments that were major problems for the Structuralists. Ultimately, the Gestalt School gives rise to other fields of psychology, such as Sensation and Perception and Cognitive psychology. In relation to attacking the Behaviorists, they tried to knock learning by examining insight learning where things basically just come to you out of the blue. However, overall, the Gestaltists had little impact on the Behaviorist school because of the objectivity that the behaviorists were going to show. We’ll talk about that in a little bit. The Gestaltists also had major influences in social psychology, where as we see in slide 11, behavior of individuals or groups can be controlled by the whole situation. So what they argued was when you had lots of things together, you put some kind of new meaning to it, and as a result of that, you are able to determine and make new things. Again, points to note. For the Gestaltists, on slide 12, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. I’ll give you a final example and see if you can come up with the product. Here we go; what is this substance?Carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup and/or sucrose, caramel color, phosphoric acid, natural flavors and caffeine. Now if you might think about that, a lot of things come to mind. However, if we could add one more word to the product , “Rum” what do come up with? Well, the first thing is that it’s a Coke. And when you say Coke, there is a perception that you develop. When you put rum with that, a rum and Coke, you develop a perception or a thought about what a rum and Coke is. However, if you put something different to that, such as a rum and Pepsi, it’s just not quite the same. It’s a little different from the idea that you have of a rum and Pepsi. A rum and Coke is totally different. And if you have consumed both products and tested them side by side, you will know what I’m talking about. So, as a school, the Gestalt School did not have much impact at it’s time, but it had major influences in other areas that will be used by other psychology areas later in the future. 
Now in addition to this group, other people came along who were also behaviorists. These are called the Radical Behaviorists. Not from the sense that they were far out on the extreme, but on the sense of what they were trying to propose. As you can see here, these are individuals like Skinner, Estes, Premack, and many, many others. They are also called the Neobehaviorists, a la, new behaviorists. They, in essence, recapitulate a lot of the things that Watson was talking about that went away with the Instrumental Conditioning theorists (primarily Hull, Tolman, and others). The focus of the Neobehaviorists was instead of looking at the stimuli and having their impact on behavior, what they focused was on the consequences of the behavior. What follows a particular response. That is, the rewards and punishers. This group of psychologists will have huge, huge impacts in all areas of psychology. In addition to that, they will have major impacts in areas such as education and business and on and on and on. We will talk about the these psychologists in great detail later in the course, but their impact in psychology has been absolutely tremendous, and has really been one of the things that’s made clinical psychology what it is today. The next group, are also behaviorists but they have a different take on things. These are related to what we call social learning or observational learning types of folks. As we see in slide 24, the major player here is Bandura. Basically, what Bandura contends is that a lot of the learning we do occurs through observing other things, or observing other people. The other major name for this field is ‘Modeling. ” What does the model do and then what do you do?
The next major group of behaviorists emphasize different things. These are the Cognitive Learning Behaviorists. What the cognitive psychologists emphasize are the internal processes of the behavior. That is, don’t give me this stuff about the stimuli or the consequences, really what’s the most important thing is what is happening inside the person. What are those variables inside the person that caused us to do things? Thus, things such as personality variables become very important. What’s your personality like. Will that make you do something or will that not make you do something. Or internal versus external locus of control, attributes, and how the mind, in essence, influences the behavior are the things that’s the most important. The problem with the cognitive models of behavioral psychology is that they often use correlational data to make causal inferences, and there’s a problem with correlational data. In addition to that, concentrating only on the mind and not the behavior doesn’t always work. For example, if you’re trying to increase work performance, working with a cognitive model and changing a person’s internal expectations and on and on and on, oftentimes have much poorer results than just giving you an extra five bucks for every widget that you make. So as a result, in some areas of industry and other places, cognitive models do not work very well. We will again talk about cognitive models in great detail as we get later in the course. The thing, though, about cognitive psychology is that it is currently the dominant field of psychology today despite its problems. The next major model is as we see in slide 28, is the cognitive information processing models of learning. These are a little bit different than what we’ve talked about before, and have lots of different players as well. This field comes out of a lot of the early memory literature, and people such as Chomsky, Broadbent, Craik, and many, many others will have major contributions in this area. As we said before, and as we see in slide 29, most of the information processing models primarily come out of the memory literature and what they’re emphasizing again are the internal processes of a particular behavior. Again, what happens inside the organism or the person is important. But the focus is not the function of a particular structure, although some people talk about that. The focus is more of what is going on, that is, the processing systems that are working in the systems. This area of psychology has made major impacts in how the mind works. For example, we understand what’s going on within the system such as how much work that you can do, how much your mind can do before it collapses, or before you begin making mistakes. As a result, this area has made major contributions in industry and design. The classic example is an airplane cockpit where the pilot has to a wide variety of different things. If you make the pilot do too many things at one time, then the pilot makes mistakes. So what you have to do is break down tasks in the hierarchy, or you have a co-pilot in the system, or you develop a computer to take care of some of the tasks of the flight while the pilot is flying the plane. So in essence, these major schools of psychology are what we’re going to begin talking about. Not primarily within the Structuralist model or the Gestalt models, but within some of the more traditional learning models. We will continue from the late 1800s through the present, These areas are really what made psychology develop into what it is today. So the next time when we get together, we’ll begin talking about an early model of psychology. That will be classical conditioning. So until that time, you have yourself a good day and we will see you soon. 
Now a second variable that relates to cognitive control and internal variables is what we call self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is the belief that you have in your own ability. That is, the confidence you have that you will succeed at something. So individuals with high self-efficacy believe that they can succeed at anything, whereas individuals with low self-efficacy believe that they can’t succeed at anything at all. A third variable relates to what we call expectancy, and this is shown in slide seven. Expectancy basically relates to what your expectation about what will happen in a particular situation. For example, if you believe that you will get an A on your exam, you then engage in particular behaviors usually to help you get that A. So it’s your expectation about what will happen is that the most important and is studied by these cognitive learning theorists. 
The next variable that’s examined are what we call personality variables. There are many variables that are examined and some are listed in slide eight. For example, there’s the big five. So let’s walk through each of those beginning on slide nine. The first one is what we call agreeableness. This is the classic example of a personality variable. For example, is the individual sympathetic, warm, trusting, cooperative, etc. This is a little different from extroversion types of personality variables. Extroversion and introversion basically relate to how talkative, social, fun-loving and affectionate individuals are. If individuals have highly extroverted, they basically walk into a room with anybody and start having a great time, are fun, talkable, and everything else. Or if they are kind of shy and withdrawn, which would be low, this would be introversion. By the way, professors tend to be very introverted for the most part, even though we do do well in certain situations. Conscientiousness is another personality variable that’s examined. That is, how ethical, dependable, productive, and purposeful you are within a particular environment. The next variable is shown in slide 12 and relates to what we call neuroticism. Are you anxious, insecure, guilt-prone, self-conscious and on and on. These are a variety of different variables that relate to different aspects of personality that we study in different models of learning. And finally, how open you are (shown in slide 13). Are you daring, are you non-conforming, do you have lots of interests, are you imaginative, or are you the opposite of each of those. So again, these are a variety of different personality variables that are aspects of internal variables of cognitive psychology. All of these different things are investigated.
