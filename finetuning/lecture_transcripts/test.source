Now a third school also developed around this time and this, as we see on slide 13, is the Functionalism School or the Functionalists. There are several major players. They include people like James, Hall, Cattell, and Angel. They also developed as a reaction to the Structuralists and were basically a United States phenomenon. As we see in slide 14, the Functionalists weren’t really concerned with the elementary elements of consciousness. They were more concerned with how the mind works. What mediated between the external world and the internal events that were located inside the body? That is, what is the function of things? What is the function of the cortex, the hypocampus, the hypothalamus, and on and on and on. In addition to that, from a little less physiological measure, how does an organism adapt and survive? What are the things that allow an organism to adapt within its environment? That is, what is the function of certain things, such as your thumb or a big toe or whatever it may be. As a result, the functionalists examined both humans and animals to try to determine what the function of some particular thing was. And as we see in slide 15, the key for the Functionalists is, “What is the function of some behavior?” We could take an example of that. What is the function of love? So the importance is not on the components that make up the behavior, but what is the function of that particular behavior. What is the function of doing something? As a result, they studied real life events and ultimately they allowed psychology to be applied into industry, education, medicine and many other areas, and that is where it’s primarily used today. 
In the last sections we have examined a wide variety of aspects related to classical and operant, and instrumental conditioning. In this section we begin talking about the last major and the current model of learning that is pretty much used by a lot of people today. These are called cognitive models. So, let’s begin by looking at some of the theorists of cognition which is shown on slide two. As you can see, a lot of the theorists of cognitive psychology relate all the way back to Plato. They include people like Tollman, Hull, and a variety of other people such as Anderson. In the last sections that we’ve talked about within instrumental and operant conditioning, we talked about some kind of stimulus causing some kind of response. And then following the response by some consequent stimulus. It depended upon the particular approach that one took whether one focused on the initial stimuli or the consequent stimuli following a response. In cognitive models, what is focused on is not the consequent stimulus or the initial stimulus, but what is going on inside the organism. We will talk about and label that stimulus with an O. So, what goes on inside the organism is the most important thing for cognitive theorists. So what kind of internal variables are investigated with different cognitive models of learning. These are listed on slide four. (For example, locus of control, expectancy, etc. ). So, let’s look at some of these variables a little more closely
The next major aspect that we look at when we examine internal events relate to what are called traits. The classic person who’s looked at traits is Allport . Allport defines three different major traits that we have. So lets examine these for a minute. Cardinal traits for Allport (as we see in slide 15) are traits that dominate an individual’s life. That is, your passion to serve others, to acquire wealth, or whatever they are. It’s basically things that dominate your life and makes you behave the way you are. The second type of trait is what we call central traits. These are shown in slide 16. These are descriptive traits that you would use to describe someone. Are they nice, do they dress well, etc. And finally, we have what are called secondary traits. That is, these are traits that are not obvious, that show up in particular situations. For example, aggressiveness with an individual who’s pretty mellow and cool but when they get to a baseball or a basketball game, they turn into a total monster. These are traits that are not normally obvious to an individual, but show up in particular situations. So in general when we look at cognitive psychology and cognitive learning, what we look at are internal events that are out there. And basically these internal events are all examined within cognitive models. Again within a cognitive model, the focus is on things inside the organism. that is, the mind. And as a consequence of that, the models are much harder to measure than some kind of objective behavior that’s usually discussed by Skinner and others. So in general what we see here is that we have a variety of different things that relates to cognitive models of learning. In the next section, we will continue on with this discussion, so until then have yourself a great day.
