In the last couple of sections we have been examining a variety of different memory aspects. In the two previous sections, we looked at early theories of memory (stage or multiprocess theories). Then we examined some different brain structures that were involved in memory. In this section we begin a discussion of the second major memory model called depth of processing models. As we see in slide two, there are many different types of theorists associated with these models, but the two key papers are by Craik and Lockhart and Craik and Tulving. These are the classic papers that basically set the approach for everything. Depth of processing models take a different approach than stage theory. In essence, depth of processing models rely on a computer model of memory. In many ways it’s similar to stage theory. However, the major difference is the way people view how the memory storage process occurs. Specifically, theorists believe is it’s a more active process than the passive process described by elaborative rehearsal in the Atkinson and Shiffrin model. So let’s examine an example of a computer analogy in slide four. In sensory memory, what we have is some kind of sensory memory going in the short term memory and then in the long term memory. If we look at a computer, what we have is some kind of input that moves into random access memory, and then that material is saved in the hard drive. When we want to retrieve the data, the hard drive material is moved to random access memory, and then we can do something with it. What goes on in memory says Craik and Lockhart is that memories are processed (shown on slide five) not held in storage by some brain structures. Basically, they contend it’s not the storage capacity of the short term memory that’s important, but the amount of information that can be processed at any one particular time. That is, it’s a processing limitation. As a result, it’s very similar to the random access memory limitations that you have within your own computer. That is, you can only have a certain amount of material going on at one time within your computer. And if you exceed that amount the system crashes. So how does memory enter the system? Or, how does information enter the system? What we see in slide six is called depth of processing. Depth of processing looks at shallow versus deep processing. So what is shallow processing? Well, as we can see in slide seven, shallow processing is basically the superficial characteristics of a stimulus. It is the sound. It doesn’t require a lot of work. You just know that it's there. In contrast, deep processing, as we see in slide eight, refers to determining what the meaning of the sound is. For example, the meaning of the sound that you’re listening from me is all the different words and things about some aspect of learning. There may be other sounds out there as well. In this office I’m hearing a light buzzing in the background, and I hear my computer buzzing as well. So the sound is the shallow processing and determining the meaning of each sound is the deep processing that goes along with that. Now there’s a variety of different components that are important within this processing system and these are shown here on slide nine and include organization, chunking of the information, pneumonics, and imagery. Ultimately, all of these components are used within our recognition and our processing of information. Now there’s some important aspect as well and this begins a discussion of what we call schemas. Schemas, as we see in slide 10, basically help with the processing of the meaning that we have. And in general, the more knowledge you have about a particular object, the easier it is for you to recall. The question then became why? In essence what you do is develop some kind of a framework to recall the particular piece of information you have. So as we see with an example in slide 11, they help you to enhance your memory. So let me give you an example. Don’t look at the content on the side of this page. What I’d like you to do is identify the following. It’s an animal, it walks on legs, it lives outside, it eats grass, apples and many, many other things. What is it?Well as you can probably think, there are lots and lots and lots of possibilities. As we can see over the next couple of slides, what you try to do is narrow the possibilities. So when I say. “It says moo,” you know that it’s a cow. But on the other hand, I say that it says “baa,” then we know it’s a sheep. So, as we narrow the possibilities, you have a higher probability of recognizing what the particular thing is. So, (as we see in slide 14) as we narrow the possibilities, you get better recall with the more associations you have and ultimately the recall you have for a particular object. All of these aspects of schemas represent different and deeper levels or information processing, and the more associations you make the deeper the processing. Thus, the reason that you perform better on things such as overlearning and other tasks is that the processing and schemas you develop are deeper. We see this on slide 15. In general, organization is related to deep processing. So the more you have, the better off you are. So ultimately as we narrow the possibilities, schemas refer to cognitive structures in which some kind of data events are answered. They’re very broad and there are few specifics that go with them. So how do we get stuff that’s a little bit more specific. Well one of these relates to what we call scripts (which are shown in slide 17). Scripts are related to schemas, but they describe characteristics of a behavior that occurs within a particular setting. So, I’d like you to think about going into a restaurant and what happens. What’s the script that occurs?We get to the restaurant and we walk through the door. We are greeted by a receptionist of some sort. The receptionist then takes our name and seats us. If we have to wait for a couple minutes, we sit around. If they have our reservation, we then go to some particular table. After being seated, what happens? The menus are then brought around, we are asked if we want to have some kind of adult beverage, and then we scan the menu and order the particular food. We then eat the food, after it comes. We then engage in some light conversation, and then we pay the bill and leave. So, basically what we see is there is a specific script to what is going on. Now there’s another aspect of memory that’s important as well and that is what is called spreading activation. The spreading activation concept was developed by Collins and Loftus. Basically what they argue is that words and concepts are linked through complex systems of relationships. These words and concepts are in essence called nodes. The association between nodes are indicated by lines or arrows, and the shorter the line, the stronger the association or link. Thus the stronger the activation. This is what we see in the following figure on slide 19. Let’s say that we are going to start with the concept of fire engine. In fire engine, what we have is a variety of different links. Some are very short, some are much longer. The short ones are things such as the color “red,” which we always think of as red fire engine. Red also triggers similar concepts of ambulance. It might also trigger a concept such as fire truck. Longer concepts may be the fire house or the actual fire itself and on and on and on. Note that each of these concepts also trigger other things. So when I say the word fire engine, it basically spreads an activation of memories across the brain system and across your memory model. In general, we have talked about depth of processing models. It is a much more elaborative model of memory and as a result we have a more detailed analysis. In the next section, we begin to discuss some aspects of other things related to memory, such as forgetting, decay, and retrieval of memories. So until that time, have a great day. 
Psychologists have many theories to explain how we remember information. The most influential theory is that memory works as a kind of storage system, or storehouse, for information. According to this theory, there are three types of these storage systems with different functions that hold information for different amounts of time. These storage systems are sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Sensory memory holds information for the shortest amount of time—less than four seconds. An instant. Sensory memory is where stimuli, or things that stimulate our senses, are very briefly stored. We forget sensory memories almost instantly, unless they pass into another storage system. Examples of stimuli that usually go into sensory memory are things that we see and hear in the world such as a flash of lightning, or the sound of a door closing. Short-term memory, which is also sometimes called “working memory,” holds information for about 15 to 25 seconds. This is not a very long time, but the information that passes into this system has more meaning for us than just sensory stimulation. It is not entirely clear how some sensory memories transfer into more meaningful short-term memories. Some experts believe that sensory information changes into visual images as it is stored, and others believe that information changes into words. However, it has been proven that memory going into this system is made up of “chunks,” or groups, of meaningful information (for example, single letters or numbers or more complicated sets of information), and that only around seven “chunks” of information can be stored in short-term memory. Therefore, there is not a lot of room for information in short-term memory, and it does not stay there for very long. Examples of the type of information that typically goes into short-term memory are telephone numbers, addresses, and names. Long-term memory holds information almost indefinitely, although retrieving it can sometimes be difficult. Think of long-term memory as a very big library, or even a computer chip, with almost unlimited capacities for storage. Information gets filed, catalogued, and stored. Long-term memory has several different components, or modules, that correspond to separate memory systems in the brain. The main two categories of long-term memory are declarative memory and procedural memory. Declarative memory is where we store factual information, such as names, faces, dates, life events. Procedural memory is where we store memory of skills and habits, like how to ride a bike or how to boil an egg. Within declarative memory, there are smaller categories of memory, or subdivisions—episodic memory and semantic memory. Episodic memory is where we place memories that relate to our personal lives, things we have done or experienced, such as having a car accident, celebrating an important birthday, or graduating from school. Semantic memory is where we organize general knowledge or facts about the world, such as math formulas, spelling rules, and capital cities. 
okay lecture we're back on chat how is that looking i'm good all right awesome great okay sorry about that guys welcome back to the lecture um so if you weren't here for the first lecture my name is rohan suresh and i am one of the co-instructors alongside sami alcati he's not here right now but he's in the chat he's in the chat and he'll be answering any questions you guys have all right so what are the goals for the class today so the goals of the class are firstly to go over class logistics secondly go over what is bash and what exactly will be doing with it third we're going to go into batch setup for different operating systems and finally we'll do an intro to bash okay just double check is can you guys hear me okay and is the screen okay okay all right sorry about that guys yeah guitar wi-fi is kind of bad and i apologize about that all right so first things first general logistics communication oh thank you awesome so communication first things first join the piazza so this uh lecture will be up on the website very very soon join the piazza for almost all your questions regarding the class homeworks lecture content um due dates etc you'll find that in piazza discord for group communication so we do a lot more than just that in discord like i you know span the chat when the twitch is about to go up if you have any questions like i am on discord pretty much 24 7. so is sami we'll answer questions pretty much right away if you have them so discord is a great resource the cs96 website is great for finding the syllabus lectures important links etc and email so we won't be here for you if you have any emergency please email us i you know we're not going to be mad if you reach out to us via email we really want to help you guys out and if you have a personal question you should post on piazza and post a private thing to us lag disappointing okay homework will be assigned a prairie learn and it's going to cover content from the lecture it's pretty basic stuff for the most part we're not going to ask you to do anything too extensive it shouldn't take too long uh we just want you to have like a reiteration of what you saw in the lecture so welcome to part one of bash so our goals gonna take you from a bash beginner to being a bash wizard literally hacking the matrix you're gonna learn all this today so what is bash so bash is a text-only interface which can be used for controlling unix-based operating systems so it's an acronym for born again shell so it's a pun on stevenborn he's the author of the direct ancestor of the current unix shell sh you can read more about that here at this link it is used in many linux machines and was used on mac os up until the new os catalina we'll talk about that in a little bit so why learn bash well firstly it looks pretty cool uh all like the movies you see with the green text like i'm gonna ruin that for you now because you're gonna see that it's all fake and you're going to be actually doing stuff through bash properly bash's standardized wave interacts with operating systems and its programs so the standardization is really really important for easy automation and manipulation of many different tasks so for example if you wanted to have something that helps you log into your ssh automatically you can do that in bash because it's standardized through many many different systems should we download anything i'm going to talk about that no worries and server side tasks so some vms may stick to the terminal so for example if you want to work on a remote server you need to use bash because they don't have a gui interface they only have the terminal and some vm as well might resecure the terminal so setup for linux if you're using linux you have no issues there's no setup if you are on is there lag rip okay bash is better than cmd okay there seems to be decent thing here maybe it'll catch up to you guys if you're lagging try and refresh otherwise i will restart the stream to spam the chat all right so if you're on mac pre-catalina nothing you have no issues bash the default shell but if you're on catalina which i'm sure most of you are you don't really do you can use zsh you don't really have to make that many changes so the default shell in catalina is zsh however for our purposes the difference between bash and zsh are pretty much negligible you really don't need to do a whole lot and you can swap to using bash by simply opening up your terminal over here and typing in bash it'll take you to bash but we're going to use the sh because that's prettier looking and it really doesn't matter for the purposes all right next set up for windows so windows kind of a pain because windows is not a unix system however there are many ways you can get around this so firstly if you're on windows 10 you can pretty easily set up a ubuntu linux shell you can find that over here in this url you may also want to download a virtual machine so you can get something called a local vm you can download a virtualbox which will essentially let you run a linux machine within windows you can also use the ews machine so if you're new you might not know what that is essentially the school has a whole bunch of engineering virtual machines that you can use well i clicked like an accident my bad the school has a let me go back to full screen the school is a bunch of linux machines that you can use for your own schoolwork but just to know you will be connected to the uiuc network so either living on campus or using a vpn and if you're in earlier form windows you shop to office hours and we will help you another cool resource is let me open up a new window it's called rapple. it i'll show it to you later basically it's a i'll post a link up here essentially you can run shell in your windows in your windows browser all right so let's start off with the basics of what control and bash looks like so you have a bunch of commands oh yeah for the kahoot let's do that right now actually if you are in the chat join the kahoot this is the code if you don't know how to join follow the instructions here use your netid as your name i'm going to drop that into the chat here don't worry i will play the music when we're doing this i just wanted to interfere with what i'm saying right now and if there's any mods in the check can just keep spamming the code there we go all right cool uh just keep joining i will give you guys a minute once we actually get into it too so i want all you guys in there so commands we interact with the bash with the bash command line through a variety of commands so these are unique statements or keywords that indicate specific tasks so a lot of it is memorization but eventually very natural so something to note is sometimes you write a single command like ls or list and it'll do exactly what you want but some commands need arguments so arguments are further variables that you put after the command to execute a task so for example the copy command that's cp needs two arguments the original file name and the name of the new file you're making so this will make more sense later uh the code should be higher up you can scroll through the mods we'll be posting in the chat too all right flags another thing that's important in bash and this might seem a little confusing right now but once we get into the actual practices it'll make a lot more sense so a lot of commands have other behavior that initialized with flags and these come at the end of the command and you can find all these flags in the man pages so if this makes no sense to you don't worry you will be a pro this by the end of the lecture so for our purposes imagine this as the system we're using so this is my computer uh this is the folder we're working with and this is what's inside the folder and to make that super clear i have this up here so this is our intro to bash folder and within it are all those directories that you saw on that diagram is this size okay for people or should i make this bigger i'll wait a sec for you guys to reply lag all right okay so if there was lag i'll repeat myself is this size okay for people or should i make this bigger bigger or right fortunately this can't be made that much bigger yeah that's the most you can get out of there all right so first command ls so a lot of these commands are pretty phonetic ls is short for list so ls will list all the files in our current directory so it's usually pretty pretty basic you just type ls and enter and the terminal will print all the files in the current directory so as for your reference this is intro to bash and these are the files in there so now i can just type ls here and all those files that we saw are here pretty basic pretty straightforward we're going to start with the basics and we're going to build up to more complicated stuff also if any questions drop it in the chat next oh yeah the flag so notice how ls is the command this dash a indicates the flag so flags indicated by a hyphen and a short letter or string and then an argument this one has no argument so this will list all the files including hidden files so a is for all pretty basic hidden files are filed to start with a dot and they're not visible in the gui or by just using ls so if you notice if i go back here there's this hidden file but you can't see that over here in the gui interface so if i do ls obviously it's not there when i do lsa all right we got a bunch more files here so what are these files the first one is a hidden file so if i open that for you you'll learn this command we can see that this is a real file has real content in it but we can't see it dot ds store so this is purely for mac os um what it has essentially if i go into this mode in max you can keep your apps anywhere you want and all that data is stored in ds store so essentially how it's formatted and how and other properties within the folder then you have this dot and dot dot so what dot is is the current directory dot just indicates the current directory that you're in and then dot dot is the upper directory so if i were to look over here the upper directory would be desktop does that make sense any other questions about this if not i'm just going to move on our next command is pwd or print working directory so as the title suggests this function will print the path to your current directory so usage like ls it has no arguments you just type pwd and enter and the term will print the path to the current directory so pwd enter and we can see the full path there up until intro to bash okay i'll check obs to see if we have decent ping all right cool okay let's clear that up also the clear command super useful it basically moves things up so like if you're if you have a bunch of text here you just type clear and it'll scroll up so you're back at the top okay lag did you guys can i explain more sure what specifically do we talk about myles m2 okay yeah so if you're in windows uh bash won't work but here let me show you guys this um right now because i think it's really helpful this website replaces languages bash if you're on windows open this up so you can follow along essentially it's just an online virtual machine that you can use to run bash commands everything i showed you can see here you can print your working directory you can clear all that cool stuff different windows try this sounds good is get bash the same as bash um there are so git bash has a different purpose to bash i'd say just try using the ubuntu version because that works really well that's what i use personally in my windows machine it's pronounced replit all right my bad lag oh the meaning of dot dot okay so i'm gonna print so i'm gonna go into this folder here called directory one okay so if i go into that folder and i do ls right or i do lsa sorry see dot dot indicates the upper level folder so it indicates intro to bash so dot dot means the folder that's just above so whatever encapsulates that folder does that make sense okay no requests i want to move on so just a reminder of what our file system looks like can you do just dot dot dot let's find out dot dot dot yup it pulls you up three times on my desktop now so i list i can go into my intro to bash and then back to directory one so yeah you can do dot dot all right so just a reminder this is our file system and we are in the intro to bash folder right now can i demonstrate ls. sure so if i do ls and an argument it will basically list the files in that directory so if i do ls regularly it'll just list these files but if i do ls directory one it'll list the files that are inside directory one so similarly if i do ls. dot it'll list the files in my desktop like so i can probably turn on the camera you guys can see me cool how do i select intro to bash oh sure i can show you so when i open up a terminal for the first time if i print the working directory i see i'm in this folder so this doesn't look pretty familiar but we can list the files and we can see there's something familiar here desktop so i use the cd command which i'm going to show you right after desktop and it'll take me to the desktop i can list the files again i see intro to batches there i do cd intro to bash and now i'm back into bash folder is this similar to command prompt yes but the commands are totally different there's a lot you can't do in command prompt that you can do in bash but yes it's very similar no we're not learning command prop command prompt has a totally different set of commands we're only learning bash right now okay so i'm gonna continue on so cd so this will kind of clear things up a little bit cd stands for change directory so cd will allow you to change directories in your bash so right now if i'm in intro to bash i can use cd to move to lower folders or i can go up to upper ones like so so i'll go back insert dash so the usage is you type cd and then your path to your new directory from the current directory how do you do dot dot again you write cd space dot dot dot dot um so then hit enter and you will change directory to the new directory if the directory does not exist the term will print an error message so let's try that for example cd fake folder now this file folder exists so if you can't see it into things that doesn't exist your computer will prevent you from doing that so if i for example if i do cd new directory we'll change the current directory to the new directory so we're at intro to bash right now all right so there's a bunch of questions about command prompt windows and bash let me just explain so the default terminal in linux machines and mac os machines because they're both unix are it's bash it was bash for mac but unfortunately at catalina i got replaced with zsh csh is slightly newer it has a few extra features but for our purposes they're essentially the same the differences won't affect what we're learning right now command prompt is windows own scripting terminal the commands you need for command prompt are totally different to what used in bash but what you can do is get ubuntu linux you get an ubuntu linux shell within uh windows that'll basically work exactly like bash and once these slides go up uh sami you have access to slides if you want to drop the link in please do that so people can use that you can also dual boot that's pretty fun too okay so for cd well then we're going to do now is go from intro to bash our red folder to directory one so we've done this a couple times already but i just want to demonstrate that so notice i'm intro to bash right now if i print the working directory and intro to bash so cd directory 1 and now when i print the working directory we are in directory 1. does this make sense how do you open the terminal okay if you're on a mac you can just hit launch pad type in terminal and open up terminal i personally use item it's an app you can download online it just looks nicer but the functionality is the same also if you have any questions at all please drop in the chat if your question afterwards i'll stay on to answer them okay so the cd makes sense and any of the first three questions first three commands make sense so far command prompt and bash can do the same things yes but that i do think bash has more functionality and there's a lot of things you can download online for bash that makes a lot more powerful whereas command prompt doesn't have that much support are we going to need bash soon absolutely the reason we're teaching ubash is because you're going to use bash to run a lot of things so for example you can run python scripts from bash so i can run python from here do you know you can run python in here right you can do a lot of powerful things in bash we're going to do all of rust and bash a lot of your project will be done in here too so bash isn't a programming language but you can use bash scripting which we'll cover in the next lecture to do some commands it's just a bunch of commands to control your computer the reason we teach you bash is because it lets you do what you can already do in your computer and even more so i'm going to move on in the interest of time so cd continued so if you type cd and start the path with a forward slash you will use what's called an absolute path so this means so what you're using here to move from directory one to the next directory is called a relative path you're moving relative to where directory one is so if i go from here to directory 2 i can write c directory 2 and it's in relative distance but if i do a forward slash i'll use an absolute path so it's not relative to anything it'll basically start from exactly where um my like file system starts and as you said before if you type cd dot dot you will move up a directory so let's actually show you this absolute path so i do pwd if i do cd forward slash users like so and hit enter now when i print the working directory i'm back here i didn't move relative to anything here i went directly to the users folder does that make sense relative absolute paths can get confusing but it's very important to learn this now because you will be using this a lot for scripts you're writing any questions about that uh ricky zao try this googling online shell and find the rebel replit link what's the difference but is that about what's yeah sure i can totally explain that again so if you're let's say you're here right let's go back to um the intro to bash folder so from here notice that we have a bunch of files here if i cd to directory 1 like so without the forward slash i'm moving relative to where intro to bash is so for example if i write cd directory one here it won't move me sorry if right cd directory one here it won't move me directory one because there's no directory one within this folder my previous move was relative to where i was but i can use something called absolute path where instead of moving up up up i can just go directly there so i can do cd forward slash users forward slash row onto rush and it'll take me directly to this folder here i didn't have to move relative to anything i just went directly there so does that make sense any questions about the relative and absolute pads makes sense cool we're going to move on so that's what we're going to do now we're going to go cd dot dot move from directory 1 to intro to bash so let's get back there so cd desktop android bash directory one so now you print the working directory use cd dot dot oh cd dot does nothing the dot single dot is your current directory won't move you anywhere cd dot dot will move you up one to intro to bash so notice we run from directory one here to intro to bash up here all right i'm gonna move on so now i'm gonna learn cat cat is let me try my videos for so you guys can focus on this cat is short for concatenate so cat is used to display the contents of a file so your usage is cat file you want to read and the term will print the contents of the file so for example you can just write cat file name and it'll display the contents in the file to read text in this file so for example let's list so let's listen here we see there's two files here there's a text file and a python file let's do cat file1. txt hit enter this is a file with some random data data originally called file. txt we also cat the python file and we can see there's a function here let's actually run the function so to run the function 3 and print the little triangle for us does that make sense does any questions about how cat works anything any questions about cat my feed might be delayed when you cut an image so often you can't cut an image but i term oh so cat is short for concatenate i'll let you read a text file or any kind of file to be honest uh but if you take an image you can't concatenate it because it'll just read actually let's let's do that i think that's a fun experiment we're going to use my professional headshot so if i do cat professional headshot yikes what is this so this is the metadata of the file because why is called concatenate because you're like that's a great question actually why is it called cad i think it's because you're kind of reading it line by line let's just allow this to go on cancel all right i'm gonna stop this because this is getting all my nerves down so why did it print this so obviously if you open the image normally it looks fine it's a regular photo you've seen this photo but when we tried to cat it this happened the reason this happened is because an image is made up of bits and bytes so the way an image is formatted is you have a header which denotes what the file is so it'll tell you it's a you know word document or an image file and the rest of it is a bunch of bits to denote the actual image itself unfortunately if you try to read those bits as text it won't work out and you have these weird symbols like these like weird unicode characters does that make sense any question about that that was a lot of information i just threw at you guys so if you have any questions about that ask me right now oh sorry i didn't say printing the arrays of an image i meant when you oh no so cat will just read the file so cat will just read the file no matter what it is so if i go to um so let's if i go to enter a bash right and i open this folder this file sorry this is all it says this is random text if i tap it it'll just read the file but if i tap image an image is made of a bunch of bits all files are made up of bits but those bits don't translate into text characters those are just a bunch of bits that denote colors and such when you try to print it out as text you get those weird characters that we saw earlier does that make sense any questions about that oh i use item so this is called item i personally like it is because it lets me do a bunch of things like i can see what my git status is it just looks cool yeah and move on from cat now oh now we'll learn touch so touch will create a file in the current directory and the type of file depends on the extension so you can make any kind of file can we use vs code absolutely i use vs code it doesn't matter what you use though touch will create a file in the current directory the type of file depends on the extension so you can just write touch file name dot file extension and you will create a file in the current directory with that name and extension so touch textfile. txt will make a text file touch python file. por like a python file touch html file. html file will make an html file so we're gonna go into directory one and we're gonna create a new file here so just for your reference in directory one right now we have just the directory in this file so let's go to directory one now we're going to touch what we call the file new file. txt new underscore file. txt enter oh my bad i used a question mark there now when i ls we can see new file. txt there and it's also you probably saw it getting animated made there how to remove file we're going to get right to that you guys are one step ahead of me so that's how you touch a file we also touch different kinds of files we can even touch a file with no extension what kind of file is it it has no extension it doesn't matter you can touch a python file you create python files you know like python dot py you can touch excel files it really doesn't matter bash and terminal are essentially like interchangeable like terminal here is zsh or bash like that's the default like it will do everything you want to ls cd print working directory it'll do all those things okay so moving on remove rm remove so rm will delete a file permanently so i need to make that very very very clear rm will delete a file permanently it will not put in the trash that file is gone you will not be able to get it back so the way you use it is rm file name and the file will be permanently deleted so chat message just write rm permanently deletes files and just spam it in the chat so everybody sees it rm permanently deletes files be very careful with it so we have a bunch of these files here let's delete them rm actually let's go back here for a sec so we'll do this first rm so watch over here r on asdf rm python whatever that was deleted rm new file. txt deleted all that stuff is gone and also it's not gonna be my trash it's permanently deleted i'm not going to rm my oh that's cool though watch this if i go to this directory here so watch if i do rm directory it won't delete a directory unless you use rmrf so rmrf is the recursive command so what it does is it will delete the file or the directory and all its underlying components this is super super dangerous if you do rmrf at like a user's page you will lose all your files all your users everything is gone so for example if i make a directory here new folder with another folder in there right so by ls now you see the untitled folder there if i try to rn the untitled folder it'll say you can't use the directory but if i do i want you guys to see this getting deleted if i do rmrf on title folder everything is gone everything inside the folder is gone if you are on system32 big rip is what i'm trying to say rm is very dangerous you can please try to avoid this as much as possible you can even aliase it to something else like move it to trash instead be very careful with this command so as you saw we took that file and we deleted it okay before we go on one last command make make a make directory so mkdir is short for make directory mkdr will make an empty directory so it's pretty basic you it's like touch user mkdir and directory name no extension and you'll create a new directory so we're going to go into directory 2 and we're going to make a new directory so so notice that we're here in directory 2. mkdir what is this called new directory and this new folder here that we've just made all right so that being said are there any questions at this point about any of the commands about file navigation about that weird thing we did the image anything at all right now drop them into the chat yo sorry directory equals folder yeah okay sudo we are going to cover that in the next lecture sudo essentially gives you what's called root access basically think of it as god mode you can do whatever you want the system itself will try and protect you and your files by preventing you from deleting stupid things like you don't delete core files but if you do sudo rm some core file the computer will usually let you do that and that is really bad so be very very careful and only use it when you totally know what you're doing can we rm a directory okay so i was going to get to this if you rm a directory it won't let you there's a different command for that but if you use rmrf like we covered here rmrf will delete the directory and everything inside it if you're on the terminal how can you save it could you expand on that question how do i move things to trash i will teach you how to move things to trash very soon yeah you can use it as a move command let you move it to trash if you make the directory whereas the new directory good question uh it'll be in the in the current directory you're in so if i'm in directory 2 by ls it'll make the directory in here so some name it'll make it here in the current directory okay why am i teaching dangerous things these things aren't dangerous these things are very very useful for your computer if misused anything can be dangerous like i could write you know i could do i could make a perpetual while loop in python that'll eat up all your ram but i'm not going to not teach you python because it could be dangerous right these are all tools that you can use depending on how you use them is up to you okay any final questions you guys have a couple seconds before i all right okay if you have a it's how to make darts anywhere i believe you can just do make dir um so let's say i'm in directory one you can just do like mkdir and you can write directory too like you can basically put the path there so i'm in directory one right now as you can see but if i do mkdir like this it'll make it it'll follow the path and put it there so that the argument the optional argument there is the path that let you make the folder there how do you move a directory i will cover move very shortly i just want to answer questions about the previous things first if you opened vim all right if you open vm and you can't get out just press escape colon q exclamation mark don't get stuck in mem so if you want to utilize bass so right now i'm actually using zsh but if you want to use bash you can just write the word bash and you will enter bash this is the exact same as before all your everything that you want is there all the same commands i like zsh because it looks cleaner and the chain difference between don't affect me my day to day don't delete terminal oh yeah sure i can totally plan to make python file you just do touch some name and just put dot p y is the extension make sense all right with that being said we're going to go to the coot i don't want you guys to not get attendance so kahoot here's the code i'm
what's up a push people today we're taking a look at Native American life pre-contact and early colonization no matter which a push book you are using this video is going to help you out for the AP exam and keep in mind over ten thousand years before Columbus quote-unquote discovered America people came to the Americas via the Bering Strait and these individuals we are going to know as Native Americans Native Americans developed a wide variety of social political and economic structures based upon interactions with each other very often they were involved with trade with nearby tribes and their interactions with the environment although Native American culture was very diverse many Native American religions were very often connected to the relationship with nature and this idea was known as animism the belief that non-human things plants and animals possess a spiritual essence so Native American religious was going to be very different than the Europeans that were going to come over to conquer in fact the diversity of Native American culture is an important point to keep in mind as Native Americans develop different and complex societies that both transformed and adapt it to their diverse environment and as you can see in these two graphics the different Native American economic activity as well as environmental regions some examples to kind of keep in mind you could see the Southwest Native American culture seen in the example of the Pueblo Indians they lived in arid land it was very dry and they relied on irrigation to grow maize or corn and other agricultural products in fact maize cultivation spread from present-day Mexico and headed north and allowed for a large population growth in the American Southwest you also have the Great Basin and Great Plains region circled in the blue and you could see this in the lifestyle of the Lakota Sioux Native American tribes there was a lack of natural resources in this region which led to the growth of a nomadic life Native Americans in this region very often moved around searching for Buffalo or the bison and then of course you have the Atlantic coast and the Northeast Native American cultures represented with the Eric white tribe in this region you see a mix of agricultural and a hunter-gatherer society there is going to be the establishment of permanent villages in many of these areas and you could see the influence of Native American tribes such as the Iroquois Confederation in the relationship with the French the English and the Dutch in the years to come so why do these Europeans come to this suppose a new world well you could break it down into the 3 G's gold glory and God many countries such as Spain and others we're looking for new sources of wealth new trade routes to places such as Asia but you also have glory wanting to increase the power and the status of not just individuals but also of countries and of course God there was a desire amongst many individuals and countries to convert the native population to Christianity and you need to understand the religious motives of colonization make sure you know about 1492 and how it is a big turning point in history with the arrival of Columbus under the Spanish flag and other Europeans that follow this leads to a massive demographic and social changes on both sides of the Atlantic both the Western Hemisphere and Europe and Africa are never going to be the same again in fact the arrival of Columbus sets off something known as the Columbian Exchange and you could see it in this graphic right there it is the transatlantic exchange of not only people but diseases food trade ideas between the Western Hemisphere Africa and Europe some examples to keep in mind our horses brought over from Europe by the Spaniards these are going to dramatically change life for Native Americans especially on the great plains it's going to make people more mobile than ever before it's going to lead to new contact with new tribes and a whole host of other consequences diseases such as smallpox brought over from Europe are going to lead to a massive population decline as deadly epidemic spread the lack of immunity to these diseases is going to lead to an up to 90% death rate amongst Native American people in some areas and food is also going to play a big role here maize or corn from the Americas is going to be brought over to Europe for the first time and this is going to fuel a huge population increase in parts of Europe it's important to note the first countries to colonize the Western Hemisphere are going to be Spain and Portugal they are going to divide up the new world with the help of the Pope with the treaty of tordesillas Spain and Portugal agreed to divide up the Western Hemisphere everything on the west of that line will be Spain's and everything to the east will be Portugal's Spain's the first to colonize what will become the United States in fact they establish the colony the first permanent settlement in North America at st. Augustine and 1565 what will become Florida and much of the Spanish Empire you're going to see the introduction of the in comiendo system where Spanish colonists receive land with native people and basically this is going to be a form of native slave labor whether it be in mining looking for resources such as silver or agriculture and especially in the Caribbean for sugar the encomienda system is going to be a very profitable yet harsh economic system in the Spanish Empire another part of the system was the Spanish sought to convert native people to Catholicism and this was a huge part of Spanish colonization and this would be very different than what the British will do and throughout the Spanish Empire you are going to see the emergence of racially mixed populations of European native and African descent you're going to get the rise of mestizos people of mixed Indian and European heritage and the rise of mulatos people have mixed white and black ancestry another important point to note is attempts to change Native American beliefs led to resistance and conflict and on this map you could see later on the missions that are going to be established throughout the coast of California but also in places such as present New Mexico Native Americans are going to resist this colonization and in what is today New Mexico a Native American leader by the name of Pope a is going to lead a revolt known as the Pueblo Revolt in 1680 this revolt leads to the death of hundreds of Spanish colonists and the destruction of Catholic churches in the area as Native Americans are rejecting this colonization this colonization was very often brought on by a belief in white superiority in order to justify their subjugation of Native Americans but under Pope Hays revolt or the Pueblo Revolt this forces the Spanish out temporarily and this revolt really shows that native peoples strove to maintain their political and cultural autonomy and when the Spanish eventually returned to the region there are force to accommodate some aspects of native culture they don't come back to the region until 1692 they are forced to allow Native Americans to continue some of their cultural practices debates occurred over how Native Americans should be treated and how civilized they were compared to European standards and these debates actually occurred amongst the Spanish themselves you have one day Sepulveda who wrote just causes for war against the Indians and in his writing he justified Spanish colonization of the Americas he said that this was a good thing and obviously if you're a Native American you're not feeling these ideas another Spaniard in 1552 de la Casas wrote a short account of the destruction of the Indies and he criticized the Spanish treatment of the indigenous people and condemned some of the things done in the name of Spanish colonization although Spain and Portugal are the first ones to arrive other European countries are going to arrive and the one we're really going to get into in video 2 is Protestant England will soon challenge Spanish colonization of North America you can see on the map a variety of European powers are going to colonize present-day North America however unlike the English colonists the Spanish the French and Dutch are going to attempt to exploit new world resources and for more complex relationships with indigenous people so although Spain and Portugal were the first to form colonies that use Native American and later on African slave labor in areas such as agricultural and mining it's important to note that France Holland or the Dutch Spain will trade and intermarry with Native Americans whereas England will not be interested in these much more complex relationships finally all European countries are going to be seeking to colonize the new world because of these ideas known as mercantilism and mercantilism is an economic theory that states colonies exist to enrich the mother country to send that money over to the mama and so this could be in the form of access to cheap raw materials such as sugar or tobacco and also to provide gold and silver so whether or not we're talking about Spanish French or English colonization it's important to know mercantilism is driving them to expand that's going to do it for this video if the video helped you out make sure you click like tell all your friends about jos productions and if you haven't already done so subscribe to the channel if you have any questions or comments put them below and have a beautiful day peace
alright alright alright today we are going to be taking a look at the administration's of John Tyler and James K Polk and roughly the period 1840 to 1848 if you're reading any of those American history books this lecture is going to help you out so we start with the election of 1840 remember there's that whole Tippecanoe and Tyler too the Whigs pick William Henry Harrison as their candidate the war hero from Tippecanoe and his vice-president is actually a former Democrat by the name of John Tyler and because of some personal beef with Andrew Jackson he leaves the Democratic Party and joins the Whig ticket in 1840 they win got a cool slogan Tippecanoe and Tyler too and unfortunately for your homeboy William Henry Harrison after 32 days in office he dies gives a super long inaugural address and just dies shortest term president ever now the problem is William Henry Harrison is now dead the first president to die while in office 1841 and the Whig party starts having beef with the new president John Tyler so the vice president becomes president but he holds many Democrat beliefs he's a Jacksonian at heart state rides kind of guy and he starts causing all sorts of problems for the Whig party because he blocks some of their goals for example he vetoes a bill to re-up the National Bank he puts a bill in place to end the independent Treasury system and the Whig party especially people like Henry Clay and Daniel Webster all angry his entire cabinet resigns now Tyler a man without kind of a party the Whigs don't want him the Democrats don't want him he tries to build a following by annex in Texas remember Andrew Jackson had recognized the Lone Star Republic Martin Van Buren though and Jackson were not interested in bringing up that controversy of trying to annex Texas Tyler does it is defeated by Whigs in Congress they don't want any more slave states added to the Union so in 1844 Tyler basically he's out no one wants him the dark horse candidate is James K Polk he comes out of nowhere he's running against the political veteran Henry Clay under the Whig party and Polk wins now Polk one of the issues he brings up in the election is the annexation of Texas he wants to do it and it's going to happen in 1845 now here's what goes down Polk wants to annex Texas talks about it during the campaign as a goal that would benefit the entire nation but it's actually lame-duck president John Tyler who submits a treaty just as he's about to leave office and he does this by a joint resolution because under a joint resolution through Congress you only need a majority not the two-thirds approval of the Senate which is the normal route that most annexation treaties take so Tyler and Nexus Texas just before Polk takes office but Polk has some goals of his own one he wants to lower the tariffs he's a Democrat the Whigs kind of favor the higher tariffs he's also from the south he wants to lower that bad boy to a big thing manifest destiny national expansion and he has some places in mind or again during the campaign he talks about fifty four forty or fight he's going to take that from England he's going to annex Texas Tyler kind of preempts that and does first and he also wants to acquire California and it's worth taking a look at this idea of manifest destiny it's a basic belief that it was America's destiny to conquer and civilize the entire continent from the east coast to the west coast and in this there is a certain level of a built in white superiority belief in this idea this idea that the continent the people that are on it are not civilized and that we are the ones to conquer it and to bring civilization to the entire continent it's ignoring that there are Native Americans there and Mexico in England and other groups the term manifest destiny was first coined by John O'Sullivan in 1845 a newspaper editor but it's important to keep in to keep in mind western expansion had been going on for a very long time if you really want to get technical from the moment the colonies you know are founded back in 1607 and onward we've been moving west and with that comes problems but we've seen this even in the early nation's history 1803 we have the Louisiana Purchase under Thomas Jefferson that brings up issues such as the Missouri entering the Union we have the Missouri Compromise Jackson's Indian Removal policies in the 1830s these are all examples of the United States moving west occupying new land but what happens in the 1840s is the issue of slavery is going to complicate western expansion more and more frequently so in 1820 that compromise resolved it but it's going to pop back up let's talk about one of the non-controversial at least when it comes to the issue of slavery moments of expansion under Polk and that is the Oregon dispute during the campaign of 1844 Polk had openly said fifty-four forty or fight the boundary of the United States is going to be at that point on the map and if you recall under the anglo-american convention of 1818 the US and England had agreed to jointly occupy Oregon Territory with England now what ends up happening is more and more Americans are coming into the area along the Oregon Trail they're making that over two thousand mile journey and it's a major issue in the election of 1844 Polk's Lane you know laying it out there we're going to get this territory well there is no fight there is no 5440 because under the Oregon treaty of 1846 England agrees to give up its claim to that territory and the boundary between the United States and Canada will be the 49th parallel you see on the map now England does agree that to do this because partly they are guaranteed fishing rights and Vancouver Island so there is a peaceful resolution to this dispute however there won't be one with our beef with Mexico and what ends up happening is if you recall Mexico still viewed Texas as part of Mexico in fact they don't recognize this Lone Star Republic Santa Ana is very clear on this issue and they also have an issue with the boundary you know is that the Rio Grande or is it the new SS River well poke attempts to buy California from Mexico because of the whole Texas issue the relations between the two countries is strained and you have his boy John Slidell going to Mexico trying to buy it California for 25 million dollars and basically Mexico refuses to even consider the offer Polk sends in Zachary Taylor into the disputed territory between Mexico and Texas and US forces are attacked in April of 1846 ultimately leading to the mexican-american war which will last a little under two years now it's important to keep in mind is this war which ends is very very controversial especially amongst northerners northern Whigs and even some northern Democrats oppose the war they see it as an attempt by southerners to extend slavery into new territories and they question especially Abraham Lincoln a young congressman from the north he introduces the spot resolution he basically says yo Polk show us if this was actually an attack on American soil and he's challenging the president's assertion that we were actually attacked on American soil you saw the controversy further when David Wilmont from I believe Pennsylvania tries to put something forward called the Wilmot Proviso which basically would have said hey we're going to ban slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico as a result of this war now this is in 1846 they haven't even won the war but they're pretty confident it passes the house because northerners have a number advantage but it is rejected by the Senate and what's important is southerners view these these protests from the north with increasing suspicion northerners are trying to attack or prevent our southern way of life well the war does take place it is horrible for Mexico they lose most of the major battles and it ends with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 and it does a number of things basically the United States territory increases by one-third the United States is given California New Mexico and the rest of the Southwest which includes places like Arizona Utah Nevada and so on the United States also gets Mexico to agree to give up its claims to Texas and they do agree to accept the Rio Grande as the border between the two nations for Mexico this is devastating about half of Mexican territory is taken and this is going to create a huge strain on the relationship between these two countries and more importantly than that for a push is this is going to create new problems because as these new territories are added to the Union it's going to force the issue of slavery back into the center of national politics that's the summary of Tyler and Polk in Chapter 17

Good morning everybody. So most of you know that Christina Seyfried is the head teaching fellow in the course. But what you don't know about her is that she's writing a dissertation, she's an advanced graduate student in political science writing a dissertation about China in Africa. And has spent much of the last two years in Nigeria, Ethiopia, South Africa and elsewhere studying just what the Chinese are doing there. She is also the brains and energy behind Yale's China-Africa initiative that has been going on for the last several years. So it seemed absurd for me to be giving this lecture when there's somebody who knows in such more intricate detail about what's going on then Christina so, Christina, welcome. The floor is yours. (audience clapping) - Great, thank you so much, professor. Welcome, everyone. I just wanna say I feel extremely honored to be giving this lecture today on China in Africa, especially because my journey really with this topic started three years ago. In my first semester here at Yale when I took a class with Professor Shapiro at the business school, and one of the lectures was on China in Africa. And I found the topic extremely interesting. And I started to read more about it. But I was a little bit not completely satisfied with the rather China centric angle that literature was taking on the topic. So I decided to write my dissertation on how African governments strategize around Chinese investments in their countries. And I spent 10 months of doing field research now in the African region. And as I said, I feel extremely honored now to be back and to be standing on the other side now of the classroom, and to teach a lecture on China-Africa myself and to share some of the lessons from my research with you today. So to start us off, I brought you a video from the forum on China-Africa cooperation, that just happened in September of last year. And China started these forums in 2000. And they have been happening every three years. And China uses them as a platform in order to announce a strategy for Africa. So in terms of loans, trade and investment for the next three year period. - [Woman] Building a community with a shared future and seeking inclusive growth, the opening ceremony of this year's summit for the forum on China-Africa cooperation, saw President Xi Jinping outline his vision for China's ties with the African continent in the new era. (speaking foreign language) - [Translator] China is the largest developing country in the world, and Africa is home to the largest number of developing countries. China and Africa have already formed a community with a shared future. We stand united with Africa's people thinking with one mind and working with one heart. - [Woman] President Xi Jinping has announced eight major initiatives in the coming three years. (speaking foreign language) - [Translator] The framework of the 10 major cooperation plans, China will work closely with African countries and implement eight major initiatives in the next three years and beyond. It feels like industrial acceleration, infrastructure connectivity, trade facilitation, green development, capacity building, healthcare, people to people exchanges, and peace and security. (speaking foreign language) In order to promote the successful implementation of the eight major initiatives, China will provide $60 billion in support for Africa. For government assistance, financial institutions, and financing from Chinese enterprises. It will include $15 billion in free aid, interest free loans, and concessional loans. $20 billion in credit funds, $10 billion in China-Africa developmental financing, $5 billion in special funds for import trade from Africa, no less than $10 billion in investment from Chinese companies over the next three years. - [Woman] Already the summit has passed two outcome documents, including the Beijing declaration and the FOCAC action plan 2019 to 2021. Participants say that in a current era of globalization, all nations have a common destiny. And to put it in the words of President Xi, everyone has in himself, a little bit of others. - So as you can see, a lot of big announcements were made at this forum. And this last image here has actually become very famous because for the first time in the history of these forums, 53 out of 54 African countries were represented. And I remember an African newspaper called Africa News wrote at the time that this was the week where the African continent was bereft of its leaders because everyone was hanging out in Beijing. So this is just really the most recent peak of China-Africa relations that have gained more and more international attention from practitioners and academics over really the past 10 years or so. But why is it that this has become such a hot topic from a developmental point of view I mean? And in order to answer this question, I would like us to take a step back and think about what are the African regions persistent growth obstacles? And I brought you a comparison here from 1982 to 2016. And you see in the 1980s, China really was poor agricultural, and had just emerged out of a series of intense conflict, namely the Cultural Revolution. And you see that China was in fact poorer than most African countries, except for Guinea Bissau and Uganda. But fast forward to 2016, China is now richer than most African countries except for Equatorial Guinea and the Seychelles. And I know in lecture four we studied very much in detail China's growth miracle. But what was meanwhile happening in the African region. So after decolonization, several African leaders starting in Nigeria, Zambia and Tanzania, tried to import substitution industrialization. And that means you basically keep your economy closed to international trade and you try to grow and develop local industries first that compete within the domestic market. But that is an economic growth recipe really failed. So after several debts and oil crisis, the IMF and the World Bank stepped into Africa and implemented so called structural adjustment programs. And the idea was that everything needed to solve Africa's poverty was real neoliberalism through the Washington Consensus. So deregulation, privatization, and liberalization. And after that, everything would fall into place. But that logic was flawed. And even after these countries went through structural adjustment programs, foreign investors weren't really willing to come to Africa still. So at the turn of the millennial, Jeffrey Sachs who was a very famous economist at Columbia. He also worked on the Millennium Development Goals with the UN. He wrote this famous piece on Africa being caught in a poverty trap. And what he's saying is that because of diseases, low stocks of human capital, technology, high transportation costs and an adverse geopolitical location, Africa is really stuck with both weak growth and weak institutions. And we have studied the modernization theory that says that growth supposedly leads to strong institutions. But the question here is what leads to growth in the first place. And he's saying that foreign investors don't want to come to the African region, because they aren't strong institutions that could enforce property rights, the rule of law, et cetera. And he's really advocating for aid as the solution to Africa. And there are economists such as William Easterly or Dambisa Moyo who highly criticize this call for aid as a solution for poverty. But it remained the fact that the African region wasn't able to attract much investment. And then, with the wake of the financial crisis in 2008, it looked even more dire because you have the collapse of the Washington Consensus. And if this hit to this overconfidence and neoliberalism as a concept and then the solution to end poverty, and you really see a retraction of Western investment in Africa, also because the West is running capital shortages, as they have to bail out banks at home. So now the question is, where can Africa attract investment from now? But as Deborah Brautigam in her book that you were also supposed to read for this lecture today, predicted, China meanwhile is rising and is running huge capital surpluses. So where others are exiting as the path of least resistance going back to Hirschman, who we have studied as well. China now fills the void that the West is leaving and increases its presence in Africa. Hence we know that China has lifted millions of people out of poverty. And I would really recommend this book by Ang "How China Escaped the Poverty Trap". So now the question is, is China just a new colonialist? Or is its presence going to add something beneficial to the African continent? And as I walk you through the slides, I would like you to think about this question, whether it is even the right question to ask and I'll also offer you my opinion, as we move along. So for today's agenda, I will provide you with a quick historic overview on China-Africa relations, then I'll give you a big picture of what China is doing in Africa today. And then we'll dive into some key questions that I think are important to ask about this relationship. And I will use two case studies, Nigeria and Ethiopia, which are among the top receivers of Chinese assistance in Africa. And then I'll talk about some lessons and I wanna bring up this idea of African bargaining power here and how much African agency matters in this relationship. And then finally I'll give you my two cents on where I think this relationship with China is going in the future. So a lot of people think that China really started to become present in Africa in the early 2000s. When in fact, we have to go back to the end of World War II. And African countries are slowly becoming independent, while China is meanwhile fighting its own domestic conflict, where the communists had just driven out the nationalists to Taiwan. And Beijing, China is now looking for allies in this Beijing-Taiwan conflict. And after independence, 14 African countries actually decided to side with Beijing here. And we have very skillful leaders like Sekou Toure in Guinea who played the United States and the Soviet Union against each other in their aid offers. And then he secretly accepted $25 million from China on the backside. China at that time is also rewarding socialists and communist movements as in Guinea but also in Ghana and Mali but after the Sino-Soviet split, which was basically about personal differences between Mao Zedong and Nikita Khrushchev, but also different ideological interpretation of Marx Leninism. Sorry, Marxism-Leninism. China has an interest in keeping up this non aligned world that neither sides with the US or the Soviet Union here. And what's really interesting is that in 1971, Beijing, China is actually able to gain back a seat at the UN that had been previously occupied by Taiwan. And Tanzania was very, very vocal here in these negotiations. So we studied how in 1978, China opened up its borders to the world. And it officially starts its bringing in period where it is trying to attract as much foreign capital as possible. And what's really striking here is that China is the only developing country in the world that is also offering aid to other developing countries. And the strategy here is very much based on its own experience as an aid recipient for example from Japan. That during that time knocked on China stores and said, we'll offer you low interest, low interest loans for technology and material and in exchange for crude oil. And we see very similar deals still being made today between China and Africa. And we studied how China was able to rise very fast. So starting in the early 1990s, China's running huge capital surpluses and is officially entering this going out period, that we're still in today. And China is trying to put its capital abroad, to invest it abroad, and it really uses its aid as a strategic tool to promote Chinese exports, and to help Chinese infant companies really grow and learn in other countries. And it also positions itself sort of as an alternative to Western aid. So in 2005 in Tanzania President Mkapa, he really when he stepped down, wanted to give his population kind of as a departure gift, a football stadium. But the problem was that Tanzania was on the list of highly indebted poor nations. And they were supposed to actually run austerity measures, and couldn't spend all that money. But then he went to China and China said, okay, we're willing to build you that football stadium. It's gonna be smaller, but we're still gonna build you one. So he was happy. But what's very interesting is that in the early 2000s, China seems to have accepted the rules of neoliberalism. And the US is an economic headroom at that time, because it joins the WTO at a lot of pressure from the US and it seems like it wants to play by the capitalist international rules that were set up by the US. But then as we studied the financial crisis hits in 2008, and this is also a hit to this overconfidence that neoliberalism is sort of the way to go. And it gets a lot of affirmation to the Beijing, China model which is the state capitalism and that it sometimes it's better if the government owns companies in a certain sector that is deemed strategic. And if you have large infrastructure investments and that sort of an interventionist approach by the government is more effective than leaving everything to the private market. And an embodiment of this new confidence that China has found is the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the Belt and Road Initiative that I'll talk about in a little bit. But I would really recommend this book by Kurlantzick here, where he also talks about the effect of state capitalism and the spread of it in today's world on democracy if you're interested. And as I said, the most recent peak of China-Africa relations has really been this FOCAC meeting of 2018 where you saw the clip, where really China is trying to rebrand this relationship with Africa and it has signal that it's been listening to the concerns about debt traps, et cetera. So it seems like the relationship has matured or that's at least the narrative about it. So what is China doing an Africa today and I'll briefly walk you through loans and trade, which are oftentimes in the news. But then I also wanna talk about investments, which is what I'm focusing on and it's a smaller sector of Chinese involvement, but growing. And then I'll also talk very briefly about China's military presence in Africa. So China's loan strategy in Africa is very much based on this idea of state capitalism, that you need to take a lot of money into your hands first, and invest in infrastructure and sort of get in the early stages of development, kind of the state to make growth happen. And as we know, African countries sometimes have shortages of money. So these loans serve that they lend to these countries now so that they can build infrastructure which is pre-stage of industrialization, in order to make growth and development happen. And just to give you an idea of how big these loans are today, we see that really, the loans from the China Exim Bank are already competing with World Bank loans. So the same magnitude that we're talking about today. But there's a big difference between World Bank and Chinese loans, namely that World Bank loans come with strings attached. So this is based on the structural adjustment programs today so we have austerity measures, and if you're expected to have fiscal prudence, where Chinese loans really have no strings attached. And a lot of people are concerned about this because if this money gets into the hands of politicians, they could misuse this, could also be a way of China sort of making African countries more dependent on itself. Or it could also be kind of China thinking long term, it gives loans to countries that can't pay back these loans. And then it can take over, let's say ports as it happened in Sri Lanka in 2017. And we'll talk about this a little bit later whether these concerns are justified. So China also gives us these loans as part of the Belt and Road initiative. And this initiative as I said, was launched in 2013. And it is part of China's going out and going global strategy. And China right now is building trade infrastructure in Eurasia. And it's really meant to build trade routes in Eurasia, that is going to compete with the Transatlantic trade route that is currently being dominated by the United States. So here you again see this confidence that China has in its own development approach. And what's interesting, China's already Africa's most important trading partner. And you can look at these graphs, I'm gonna post them up. But really, the essence of this is that China is exporting more to Africa than Africa is exporting to China. And that was also one of the big topics that the FOCAC of 2018 that China was asked by African countries to also import more from Africa. So as I said, loans and trade kind of dominating the headlines, but Chinese investments in Africa, also a growing sector. So you see that the United States and the former colonial powers is still really leading here. But if you look at a change of five years, they're pretty stable. But when you look at China, this is really rapidly increasing. And I really like this graph here, which is the comparison between US and Chinese investment flows to Africa. And when you look at the blue line here, I think it shows very nicely that you have an upward sloping trend line until the financial crisis and then under the Obama area, those flows really drop. And now if we could extend this to the Trump area, Trump he focuses more, he has more military concerns than kind of foreign direct investment priorities. But when we look at China here, you see an upward sloping trend line and there's one outlier. That's when China bought 20% of the shares of the Standard Bank in South Africa. But I think the essence of this graph is really external shocks really don't matter as much to investment flows of China, and also changes in political leadership, et cetera. So I think this shows that China intends to be in Africa for a longer, longer future. And we can't say really the same about the US, we don't know what's gonna happen. And here just to give you an idea, investments, Chinese investments in Africa, very diverse, and the biggest sectors are construction, transportation, manufacturing. And I think this really nicely fits into Sun's story of the Flying Geese Theory and the geese flying to Africa now. Where we have talked about the Flying Geese Theory a little bit when we talked about China. Capital basically moves to wherever labor is the cheapest, and we saw Japan industrialize in the '50s. And as labor prices increase there they moved to other areas in East Asia. And now because labor is increasing, labor prices are increasing so much in China. We see a lot of Chinese manufacturers moving to Africa and actually, I conducted a lot of interviews with Chinese manufacturers in Africa, in Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya, other places that are really said, I'm here because this looks like China in the '70s. And it's really amazing labor is so cheap, land is so cheap. So officially, China's saying that it is interested in an economic and sort of cultural exchange with Africa. But people are getting more and more concerned also about China's military presence, because right now China is already the Security Council member that deploys the largest amount of troops under UN command in Africa. And what you need to know here is that African countries don't really like if soldiers from neighboring countries are deployed inside their countries because ethnically which is oftentimes cross national borders. So now the AU, the African Union and the UN might like to employ and have Chinese military stationed in these countries to avoid this problem. And then China also set up its first military base in Djibouti that also raised a lot of concerns and I have a little clip. - [Woman] A fleet of Chinese ships en route to the Horn of Africa on a mission to set up China's first overseas military base in Djibouti. China's is the base will be used to support peacekeeping and relief missions. (speaking foreign language) - [Translator] The establishment of the base will help Chinese vessels escort missions in the Gulf of Eden and Somalia and international obligations such as humanitarian rescue missions. It helps China to continue to make even greater contributions to the peace and stability of Africa and the rest of the world. - [Woman] Construction began on the base last year. Although small, Djibouti is strategically placed, sitting on a busy shipping route and a stable country in an otherwise volatile region. China now joins the ranks of several other nations with military bases in Djibouti, including the US, France and Japan. But China's new base and rapid modernization of its military is raising alarm bells for neighboring countries, particularly India. With concern this base could become another one of China's so called string of pearls, building up strategic military alliances and sea lanes in the region. - So I think we can all agree that whatever China's doing in Africa, it's a very wholistic strategy. And China has really increased its presence in Africa in the early 2000s. And it seems like it wants to stay for a near and medium future. So I think there are a couple of key questions that we should be asking on this relationship that really try to get at what are China's intentions but also what is in it for the African side. So first of all, going back to our central question from the beginning, is China a new colonialist? Or is this presence adding to local development on the ground in Africa? And are the final colonialists here by a foreign power that tries to take partial or complete political control over another nation, as well as engages in economic exploitation? Then the second central question is how does China's presence add to institutional development? So sort of more on the political side. Does it have good or bad governance? Thirdly, are debt trap claims justified? And these are all questions that really media and scholarship has been trying to analyze and answer. And I would like to throw in a fourth question, which is how much bargaining power do African governments have in their relationship with China? And how do they use it? Is there leverage on the African side to influence what this China-Africa story might look like? And so on this key question of China, is China new colonialist, China's officially running a five nos policy in Africa. So it's this five nos policy is very much based on its general policy of non intervention. So that's also why China is not supporting the responsibility to protect or to keep because it's basically saying every nation is responsible for its own population. And we're not going to intervene with anyone else's affairs, as we also don't want anyone to step into our domestic politics. That's also why China oftentimes vetoes sort of intervention. So resolutions at the UN, also with Syria for example. So here you see Xi Jinping talk about his five nos policy in Africa. (speaks foreign language) - [Translator] China values sincerity, friendship and equality in pursuing cooperation. The over 1. 3 billion times people have been with the over 1. 2 billion African people in pursuing a shared future. We respect Africa, we love Africa and support Africa. We follow a five no approach in our relations with Africa. No interference in African countries pursuit of development path fitting their national conditions. No interference in African countries internal affairs. No imposition of our will on African countries. No attachment of political strings to systems to Africa. And not seeking of selfish political gains in investment and financing cooperation with Africa. - So you see here China's official stance on this is, of course, we're not a new colonialist. We're not interested in kind of political control. We're just really as I said before, interested in economic and cultural exchange. But of course they're also more critical voices on this China-Africa relationship. And I brought you here a comic by a famous South African artist. And you see basically China coming in with those big machines, and it says China's industrial colonialism. And these machines are going against the local population. And here you also see, Africa's environment is also suffering from so the expansionary vision of China and Africa. And when you look at Western newspaper reports, there are also a lot of articles like on Chinese debt trap diplomacy again with those loans, economical cold war. Is it a new colonialism? Chinese investments bring racism and discrimination. And I also talked to locals that have told me that the Chinese they just take all the jobs. So it really, everyone is split about this topic. So I would like to have a poll now on sort of from your background knowledge on China and Africa, what do you have heard from the news, et cetera, who thinks that China is a new colonialist in Africa? Okay, that's a lot of people. I didn't expect that. So who thinks China's influence in Africa is really kind of they're actually better than what the former colonialists have done? Okay, yeah. And who was split on this topic? Yeah. So I think the vast majority thinks that China is the new colonialists. So I'll just give you my opinion on this issue. So I think if China is a new colonialist, which I actually doubt is, first of all, it is a very different kind of colonialism. Because as you've seen in that famous image, 53 out of 54 African countries actually deliberately selected into it. So it wasn't like China, just coming to Africa and kind of taking over political control. but it is they are offering deals and the Chinese side is can either accept them or not. And there are a lot of speeches from African leaders from this forum that talk very favorably about China and how their relationship is different with China than with the West because of this non intervention. We also talked about how altropy is is sort of Europe centric. And it could also lend itself to again, like colonialist aspirations, et cetera. So this is sort of an agreement here. But I think obviously, the Chinese government, the West and African leaders, they're self interested actors, and they're very irrational in sort of what narrative they put out there. So I think instead of listening to what different leaders are saying here, we should focus more on impact and the variables that we can actually measure of what China is doing in Africa. And I think there are three questions that are probably the most productive to focus on if we want to have a real assessment here of whether China is a new colonialist. The first one is, is China helping to grow and diversify African economies? And this one is really important from both an economic development perspective but also from an institutional one and also in terms of democratic one. First of all, economic one because we want to see with China's presence in Africa, are African countries that are mostly agricultural now, are they moving more towards industry? And from an institutional perspective, I know we started to risk it all in detail where they're all saying we can't really predict when a democracy, like when the transformation to a democracy becomes more likely. But what can we say about its survival? So we know that democracies are more likely to survive if they have a higher per capita income than $14,000 as well as they have a diversified economy. And then I want to ask two more questions, which are is China adding local human capital and technology? And how does the competition with local businesses look like? And these two questions are really inspired by China's own growth miracle, because when China opened up in 1978, it invited a lot of foreign investors and provided incentives, all of that, to come into specific industries. But what's very interesting about China is that it actually kept a pretty strict foreign investment catalog, where it laid out certain sectors that were completely restricted to foreign investment and others where foreign investment was allowed and encouraged but had caps on foreign equity that was allowed for a joint venture requirements and also requirements and how many foreigners were allowed on the boards of companies. So they're much I summarize, this is local participation requirements. And China was using them really as a magnifier effect because China was able to import the technology from abroad and get the money from abroad, but it built a second of local managers that could then run the show. And this is also one of the explanations as to why China was able to grow and develop so fast, because locals learned very much and very fast from foreigners in their countries. And before I dive into my case studies, Nigeria and Ethiopia, I just wanna point out that, this idea that there's One China Inc. Africa is also flawed. So I know we talk about China and Africa, now also use the term just for simplicity reasons. But through my research, I found that there actually at least three different types of Chinese companies in Africa that have very different incentives that are worth studying. So first of all, you have state owned enterprises, and they're very much linked to China's sort of state capitalism model. They are very dependent on the Chinese government's control. And oftentimes, they're both driven by an economic incentive as well as sort of a different diplomatic kind of relationship, let's say between China and Nigeria where these companies are allowed to operate at razor thin profit margins. If this is important enough for the strategic relationship between an African country and China. Then you also have big private firms like Huawei who come to Africa to really they're very profit driven. I've talked to CEOs from Huawei who really want to compete with Western companies in Africa. But they have such a high profile that they can't really hide from the Chinese government. And so they're still dependent sort of, on China's, the Chinese government's strategy in Africa, and they can just do everything they want, because China's actually very concerned about its image in Africa. So they have still have to obey by certain rules. And then there's a third category which I particularly find very interesting to study which is small, private firms. So how they come to Africa is in two ways. So sometimes you have Chinese state owned enterprises being sent to Africa. And then employees in the state owned enterprises are realizing, okay, we're not really making any money. So individual entrepreneurs, they venture off and they open a small company in Africa to really make more money than that sit on the enterprise. Or we have some small Chinese private companies already in Africa that do have friends back home in China. And they will tell them all like land here is really great. Like here, the taxes really low, et cetera. So you should come from China to here. And they keep a very low profile, and they hide a lot from the Chinese government as well. But what I would also like to add is the Chinese government doesn't really care if they hide or not as long as you're not big enough to really matter. And if you make an impression, if like your company screws up and it's gonna be in the news and stuff that could be could influence this image that China has in Africa. So I also talked a lot of two or three types. And as I said, they all have very different incentives. And that matters for the stories that I'm going to tell you now. So let's first focus on Nigeria. So Nigeria as a country in West Africa. And just to give you a little bit of background on Nigeria, it has the largest population in Africa, and also one of the largest youth populations in the world behind China and India. And it's a former British colony, and it went through a military period, military regime period. And it's been formally democratic since 2015, when Jonathan Goodluck deliberately stepped down to Muhammadu Buhari and democratic elections. And Muhammadu Buhari he just ran for a second term in February and I was actually in the country during that time. So it was very interesting to observe. So what's really interesting about Nigeria is that in the '70s and early '80s, it actually had the largest textile industry in Africa. So we had some diversification of the economy happening. But when we fast forward to today, 80% of all finished consumer goods are imported. And really, the economy is not diversified at all. So what happened there? So in 1958, Nigeria discovered oil, and by the 70s, this was really the largest sector of the economy. And I think that led to really three outcomes. So first of all, as we talked with the Soviet Union, if there's one dominant sector in a country, the political elites really have an interest in keeping that one sector dominant because they can grant access to the sector and they can make a lot of money versus if you try to diversify the economy and try to provide alternatives to the population, they would not pay you anymore to get access to the sector. Secondly, there's also the Dutch disease and basically as your revenues increase in one particular sector, your currency appreciates and that makes exports from any other sector really expensive. So Norway is also an oil rich country, has tried to circumvent this issue by when it gets the revenues for its oil, it doesn't even convert them into its own currency but puts them into funds again abroad. So because Nigeria has all this oil, its GDP per capita is pretty high, but we have very high inequality. And it is one of the top receivers of Chinese investments. And those are not just investments in natural resources. But I also talked to a lot of manufacturers there, people in the service sector so it's a very attractive market because you have a huge population, very cheap land and very cheap labor. And what's important to note about Nigeria as well finally is that it really adapted the structural adjustment programs and went with it. So in 1995 it allowed 100% foreign ownership in all sectors. And really, if you're a foreign investor in Nigeria, you can basically do whatever you want. So you can compete with locals, you can make money there and you can export it abroad. So you can really have a lot of leeway there. So let's look at growth and diversification, as I said like that is one of our key questions, is China's presence adding to growth and diversification? And here you see that Nigeria actually just emerged out of a recession. And that was because of a drop in global oil prices and output chalking, Nigerian and advocate policy to really respond to this. And here you see how much Nigeria is, is really dependent on the oil industry, because over the past 20 years, the value added from industry actually declines so we don't see any diversification happening over the past 20 years unfortunately. So let's hone in a little bit on how China's presence is really adding maybe something to diversification and local participation in Nigeria. And what's interesting to note here is that in 2006, at another form of China-Africa cooperation, China announced that it wants to build eight special economic zones in Africa. And that was really based on this idea that China used special economic zones in the beginning of its opening up to really experiment with capitalism. And so they suggested kind of as a policy strategy, you should also build these zones and have tax incentives, tax holidays, and let's see what happens but the difference is that these zones are much smaller than the ones in China. So that's why they might not be working effectively. But Nigeria got two zones during this bidding process, the Lekki Free Trade Zone and the Ogun Guangdong Zone, and both are very much top down joint venture, joint venture project between state governments in Nigeria, as well as Chinese state owned enterprises. And I will show you a video now from the Lekki Free Trade Zone. - For many African countries, attracting foreign investments has always been a challenge. And now it's become even more difficult with an economic downturn in Europe and the United States. So here's how some African countries have responded. They set up what are known as free trade zones. These are places where multinationals can come in, set up shop and in some cases, a little or sometimes no tax at all. It really does beg the question, what's in it for the ordinary African. Mark Edwards been checking up on that in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation. - [Mark] In Lagos they hope this will be the road to economic success. The Lekki Free Trade Zone is being carved out of thousands of hectares of untamed land near the coast of Nigeria's commercial capital. - The first part is 3,000 hectares. - [Mark] They call Sola Oworu the Empress of the zone. This former city banker is in charge of creating what she believes will become the Dubai of West Africa. - The idea is actually to create a new model city, not just industrial, also a residential, commercial area, so that you have a self sustaining city. - [Mark] While Lagos State providing the land, a Chinese consortium is responsible for the actual construction. There's a lot to build. The zone will have its own international airport, deep sea port, and its own water, power and sewage systems. - The idea is to have the zone as a catalyst for economic development in Lagos State, diversify the economy, we would want to attract foreign direct investments into Lagos State. - There are 23 other Free Trade Zones in Nigeria, all vying for the attentions of international investors. But the Lekki Free Trade Zone here in Lagos has one big advantage, size. At 16,500 hectares it could become the biggest in Africa, four times the size of Manhattan in New York. - So this is a video from 2013. And what's striking here is that you can't really see the zone itself, right? So I tried to find videos where you have some video footage, what it actually looks like, but I couldn't so I would have liked to show you. So I was wondering about that myself. So I went to the zone and I drove there and when you arrive there's a really nice building in front with the administration and like they welcomed me and I could talk to the MD, the managing director on the Nigerian side as well as on the Chinese side and everyone said, yeah, the zone is gonna be amazing and like all of that potential and it really is going super well. And then a team of engineers took me around the zone. So we came behind the administration building, and what you could really see was not that much, because there wasn't. So there was some basic infrastructure built. But I was driven around and I talked to a few companies that were really only 14 fully operating Chinese companies in the zone. And that was after 13 years of being built, right? So I think it lags a little bit behind expectations. And one of the reasons I see is really, because it's more of a top down joint venture between two governments. So as I said before, you have Chinese state owned enterprise involved. And it is kind of bound to this diplomatic relationship between Nigeria and China and it is a prestige project. So that's why they build a lot of infrastructure there. But how to make the zone actually work is a different story. It is a very profit driven story. And when I saw kind of the management building and then like the office is there, they're very comfortable in that position, I don't really see that big of an incentive to go out of your way to really attract all of these companies. So while there's tax holidays, so no taxes inside the zone, there's a very high management fee actually. And I talked to companies that had considered moving into Lekki Free Trade Zone, but they didn't find it profitable because they were too small for the management fee to make sense. And finally, they were also locals that have been protesting because of resettlements. 'Cause that used to be their land who have been protesting a lot. And in 2012 actually, one of the managers of the zone got killed. So they'll have problems to make the zone really, really work and profitable. And we have a similar story for Ogun Guangdong. So now though I would say it is performing slightly better. So it was started with a Chinese state owned enterprise. And then they were caught up in some smuggling problems. And then a Chinese company actually took over the zone, the management of the zones. And they were more interested in kind of making the zone work because they were more profit driven. But then the Chinese government kicked them out, I believe two years ago and put in again, a Chinese Special Economic, SOE, State Owned Enterprise, because they felt like they had more control over what that company could be doing with this prestige project, which meant a lot for the diplomatic relationship between Nigeria and China. And there's a very interesting story that I would like to share with you. Professor Shapiro and I, we both separately, interviewed the private management at that time of the zone. And they told us they had one big problem, which was someone was blowing up the gas pipelines that were coming to the zone. So who do you think was blowing up these pipelines? Yes. No, it was not terrorists. Yeah. So what's really interesting is that you actually had locals blowing up these gas pipelines because they started sort of as a local competition, or like as a foreign project that they weren't really being able to have any advantage of. So again, have locals seeing the zone and like seeing the infrastructure, but not really being able to participate. And as I said like in Nigeria, you can kind of just come in as a foreign company and you don't have to employ locals or train locals or have them on or kind of give them ownership. So I've heard a lot of stories of competition between Chinese companies and Nigerian ones. And obviously competition is good for kind of growth. But there's also the flip side of local inclusion. So I guess that is the trade off here. And I know these stories are just anecdotal. So I have like, for example, in the bike ride hailing services, and there's a really aggressive Chinese company right now or in the FinTech industry, whether a lot of Chinese companies Offering loans to locals, just competing on price alone. And I'm going to conduct a survey experiment with Chinese companies next semester in Nigeria to kind of get more at the trend here. So I don't only wanna talk about negative things about Nigeria, so they also some positive developments here. So for example, Aliko Dangote, he's the richest African right now. And what you need to know about Nigeria is that it exports all of its crude oil and imports the refined oil, because it's not doing the refining itself domestically. So Aliko Dangote is now currently building an oil gas refinery, in Lekki Free Trade Zone to solve this problem. And I talked to locals and they generally actually feel positive about it because they're excited that this is now finally that there's some domestic refinery here. I would be a little bit cautious because 20 years ago, Nigeria had this law that not one private businessman could own that much oil in that industry just because of national security concerns, right? And I think Aliko Dangote is getting a lot of political power because of this now, because he controls, he can just stop the oil immediately. He is also, I heard he wants to also sell it at kind of international prices. And if the government doesn't really comply with what he wants, he can just easily export the oil as well, because he's in the Lekki Free Trade Zone where they have an airport and a seaport. But what I'm more excited about are these small Chinese industrial parks. And I know you also had to read an article on this. Where through an interview, a local Nigerian broker who work with Chinese companies, he invited me to his village and he said, I live in this village where the local chief he set up an industrial park with Chinese and I should come visit. So I drove there for a weekend and I interviewed all the Chinese companies there and I also talked to the local chief. He invited me for tea and we just sat and chatted. And this looks like much more like a bottom up sort of win-win situation where in the '90s, a Chinese businessman, a private one came to that village and he wanted to do some fishing there. So his people they built two houses for the village chief, for his palace. And kind of as an exchange, he was allowed to fish there and then he brought more and more people, small, private Chinese firms and they build this industrial park. And they prefer being in that small industrial park to being in the big ones because it's located on a very strategic street that goes from the south to the north and they produce mattresses and slippers and all of that and they actually also get tax benefits from the state government because the village chief talks to the state government and they also employ locals and have them not as office managers, but at least as floor managers. So there seems to be more promise here. So I wanna contrast the Nigerian case with the Ethiopian one and Ethiopia is a country in East Africa. And I'm comparing it because it is the second most populous country in Africa. So similar in size, it has never been colonized. Except for a short period of where the Italians occupied Ethiopia during the Second World War. It went through a communist era. But then what's really interesting is starting in the 1990s, where you have an authoritarian regime, arising the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. And Ethiopia also went through structural adjustment programs, but they didn't apply them one to one. They sort of like China that also went through structural adjustment, took the pieces that they felt like that would work in their country and left everything else out. So in 2002, they adopted an industrial policy strategy. And that transformed into two growth and transformations plans that are very much based on the Chinese and Korean developmental models. And when we look at Western investment flows to Ethiopia, after 2003, they have like really declined because there was sort of, the Western companies weren't able to just operate in this market anymore, because like in China it was more strategic, like some sectors were closed, some are open to foreign investment. But Chinese investments stocks meanwhile, rose a lot. And it's already ranked 11th for amount of Chinese investment stocks in Africa. And I expect it's gonna join the top 10 very soon. So when we think about growth and diversification in Ethiopia, this is a much more positive story. Although Ethiopia is also starting from a much lower level, of course, and it's much poorer than Nigeria, because it doesn't have this oil wealth. So now Ethiopia is actually the fastest growing economy in Africa right now. And it's in the news for that a lot. When we look at industrialization, this graph looks very positive, but actually when you compare over the past 20 years, the shelf industry has only grown by I believe it's 11%. And most of it is coming from construction, which is kind of the pre-stage for industrialization. So it looks promising, but we aren't there yet. And actually, we see a lot of movement from the agricultural sector towards services. So Ethiopia looks more like India now, than Korea or China, although it has this industrialization policy so. What are some positive developments here by the Ethiopian government that were implemented? So first of all, Ethiopia has really tried to ramp up primary education enrollment over the past 10 years, and it isn't that 100% now so obviously, this isn't the perfect measure of quality education, but it's one measure to look at sort of human capital stocks and then how there's human capital growing in the economy. And as I said Ethiopia is also very strategic and has a local content initiative where some sectors are completely closed off to foreign investors. In some sectors, they are open but there are a lot of incentives for joint ventures. And even informal sort of deals. Investors are always expected to come up with a strategy and a proposal of how locals are going to benefit from this investment that is being made. However, there's the study by Blattman and Dercon, which I found very interesting. They tracked industrial workers in five different factories in Ethiopia, and actually 70% of them quit after one year. So again like there's potential in Ethiopia for industrialization, but it seems like there are more options still in the agricultural and informal sectors and people aren't really picking up these industrial jobs yet on or running with them. So I do think industrialization is happening in Ethiopia right now. But locals should be incentivized to pick up these jobs and stay for longer and they were also health concerns. So there were a bunch several blocks to move out of the way. And here's the Eastern Industry Park. And this is also one of these eight Chinese special economic zones that were placed in Africa, after China announced they want to build them in 2006. But this is a very, very different approach to what we saw in Nigeria, because this is actually a bottom up, very private initiative. So it's a private Park. And there was one Chinese businessman that came to Ethiopia in 2006. And he wanted to build a pipe factory. But then he heard about these biddings for these special economic zones. And he applied for one and he brought one of them to Ethiopia. And in the beginning, the Ethiopian government was very much against it, it was like very skeptical of what was happening there. But this private Chinese businessman, he brought government officials from Ethiopia to see the zones in China. And over a while the Ethiopian government really got into this idea of special economic zones. And in 2015, they even implemented industrial zone framework and they have four more zones planned now here and there are 83 Chinese companies operating in the zone already, although it's much smaller than the ones in Nigeria. So you have some footage from there. - [Girum] If you look for some of the best China based companies operating in Africa, chances are you'll find most in this humongous industry zone. Located about 30 kilometers outside of Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, the Eastern Industry Zone is a place for the multi faceted industries from China. - This industry is first industry in Ethiopia. And this industry is a wide stage for the foreign investor. And this one is we get support from both of Ethiopia and China government, because they know in China government, we have the experience, how to build these industries, and how important to attract the foreign investor. Also now Ethiopia, they want to develop the industry. And now they know. - [Girum] Since its inception seven years ago, the Eastern Industry Zone has been showcasing Chinese industrial developments positive impact here. The zone now houses best Chinese manufacturers such as Huazhan Shoes and Lifan Motors. Here there is already a conducive environment for any investor to operate. And that according to the management of the Eastern Industry Zone is key. - Now Ethiopian they give good condition. They support us like one stop surveys, like the customers credit lines, inside industries, they give good service very easy. And the here is peaceful. - Now the future equally matters for Ethiopia's manufacturing sector. There is already a big ambition to make the nation Africa's manufacturing hub. For that Ethiopia eyes the new Belt and Road Initiative to make all the dreams a reality. - So actually there have been a few academic studies done on the zone. And what they found was that actually companies are training locals. Because as I said, the Ethiopian government sort of informally requires that you come up with a proposal on how locals benefit. It isn't like for the entire zone, that there's one sort of strategy so I think that could be one improvement here, but at least you see some development. That's the locals are being trained and that local human stocks of capital are going up. So I wanna make a final point here on sort of what's in it for foreign investors on obeying with local participation requirements. And I wanna talk about the state of emergency in Ethiopia. I was actually there during that time. And basically the state of emergency broke out after the Ethiopian government wanted to expand the borders of Addis Ababa, the capital to the south to have like an industrial kind of area there and protests broke out in the Oromo and Amhara regions, and it cost them ethnic tensions, and a lot of protests and arrests, et cetera. And during these protests, locals really went to foreign companies and destroyed them because they felt like they weren't part of this growth story that Ethiopia was telling them and also you could hear in Western media. So I had a very interesting story from an interviewee there that there was Aliko Dangote, which is the richest man of Africa had one factory there. And right next to it was a Dutch South African factory. And what's really interesting is the protesters walked around the Dutch South African factory and destroyed Aliko Dangote's factory. Why? Because the Dutch South African factory, they employed a lot of locals, also gave them shares from the company. It was perceived as a local project. So in some sense, if you incorporate kind of local partners, it also mediates political risks. So let's now turn over to the lessons that we can draw from these two case studies. So first of all I think the central lesson is that deal conditions matter for development outcomes. And going back to this first question that we had in beginning, like is China new colonialist? Or can it sort of put its model in Africa and then now Africa is gonna rise, I really think that this is more about African side, strategizing rather than the Chinese dictating any model, and you see that in different sort of policy environments. The Chinese are gonna act very differently as international actors are gonna act differently as well. So I think it's more sort of African agency that is going to determine whether this is a positive or a negative China-Africa story. I also doubt that there's one China-Africa story, because we have 54 different African countries, but very different policies. And the conventional wisdom here is actually on these two conditions that African countries can't set them because they have to be deal takers in order to attract any kind of foreign capital. And this is very much this Washington Consensus Narrative, the Poverty Trap Narrative, that the region historically has not been able to attract significant amounts of investment. So you have to make it as easy for foreign investors as possible to kind of attract them. This is because Africa's population is young and under educated, low stocks of human capital poor infrastructure and political risk, sort of what Jeffrey Sachs laid out in his piece. And even with China in the picture, the African countries still have no exit options to the Chinese offer, right? So it's kind of this idea of whatever the Chinese offering, you have to accept, because there's no one else who will step in and build this for you. So as I said, I conducted 10 months of field research in Africa, kind of to try to find evidence for this. And now based on the evidence that I found, I highly doubt this entire narrative. And I say that paradoxically, I believe African countries actually have significant bargaining power with China. And I think this is fundamentally based on the idea that Africa doesn't just have all these weaknesses, that the poverty trap list here, but in fact, Africa is the region in the world with the most amount of natural resources. The cheapest labor in the world and the cheapest land. And in contrast to the West, China has both willingness and capacity right now at its developmental stage, to put its money into Africa and to really get returns from these factors that look very attractive and lucrative to China here. So completely, China has massive capital surpluses as I said and it needs raw material to fuel its growth. Africa is the last region to industrialize. So as I said, I interviewed a lot of Chinese manufacturers that are really excited about the African markets, because it's so much cheaper there to run a factory now. Africa also has export deals with the UN, the US. So actually, when they want to export goods, they don't have to pay any tariffs. So as a Chinese if you produce in Africa, it is cheaper for you and in a lot of cases. What's also interesting, I want to focus data in and I interviewed someone who is still in Nigeria and the President said that in 2016, China increased its environmental regulations in symmetric market. And in that year, you saw a lot of Chinese companies that did not want to obey with these environmental regulations to Africa because, for example Nigeria doesn't have these strict government regulations. And finally, Chinese companies also seem to be less risk averse to political instability. So you also have a lot of Chinese investments in South Sudan, for example, which is not politically very stable. So I think that Western investors are much more sensitive, they also stay to these kind of political and safety concerns. They stay a lot of urban areas, where you see a lot of Chinese in rural areas. And I think that what's the most important is that certain concerns with Western investment that limit African bargaining power, are less alien with Chinese one. So first of all, you could argue that because China is offering all these loans to Africa, it makes these African countries very dependent on China. But actually Deborah Brautigam, who is one of the leading scholars here, she wrote a lot on this and saying, the magnitude of this is really overstated. And then you see countries like Ethiopia who have taken out much more debt with China actually being more aggressive with China than others which are smaller debtors like Nigeria. Secondly, China is also really trying to compete with the West. And the number of allies matters. Also at the UN we see that UN General Assembly, these African countries on certain things they vote with China. And if you're Ghana or if you're Nigeria, you have the same vote, it's one country, one vote. So that's why China's interested in having a relationship with all these countries and economic relationship and there is the loan, trade and investment. And I think this is very important for the central point here that these African countries, there's less of a need for intercontinental competition for Chinese investments because it seems less rivalrous than what's coming from the West. And even if China's the only sort of investor here, China oftentimes prefers to be in your economy, than not be in your economy. Even if they have to adapt slightly to policies that countries imposing and you see this year, you see investment stocks from the US where like you have maybe five countries where the top receivers and the rest is getting very little. And there's a lot of competition here for US investment. But when you look at Chinese investment stocks in Africa, the first ones surely to get more, but then you have a much more even distribution of those investment pies, and you have 51 African countries that actually receive an investment pie. And yes, that is dependent on sort of China's political and economic considerations. But I run some regressions and it is very independent of whether African countries are imposing local participation requirements or not. And let's take one of these investment pies. Let's say Zimbabwe. And let's see what a policy shock does to these investments. So in 2008, Zimbabwe implemented this Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act, where all companies inside Zimbabwe had to have 51% of local ownership. And when we look at US investment flows here, investment stocks in Zimbabwe, you see that after 2006, they were not even counted anymore because they really decreased a lot. And I found a lot of qualitative evidence from Western companies here, complaining about 51% local ownership all of that and it just made Zimbabwe very, very uncompetitive compared to African countries. And of course, you also have the financial crisis hit here in 2008. That also is part of the story. But when you look at Chinese investment stocks here, they really don't seem to be bothered by the 51% local ownership here where you see starting in 2010, these stocks really skyrocket. So this is puzzling and then when we look at Algeria, we have the exact same policy change also in 2008, with 50% of local ownership required with companies. And here you see, starting in 2007, when these were announced it really like the curve really gets much more flat versus Chinese investment stocks. They just you have that upward sloping trend line regardless. And I also conducted a lot of interviews with Chinese businesses and Western businesses, try and get at these sensitivities, to local participation requirements. And really, across the board, when I asked the Chinese they were just like, honestly, like as I said, this is China in the '70s and '80s. And it's great here, I would stay under any kind of policy regulations. Versus when you ask a Western investor, they were like no, like if I had to employ locals, I would think about it twice. And I found this quote from Algeria as well. So the question is, why do some countries like Nigeria, Kenya, negotiate weaker deals in the sense of like, diversification issues and local participation, weaker deals with China than others like Ethiopia and Tanzania? And I think common explanations here are, for example corruption that countries know that they could be asking for more from the Chinese investors, but they aren't because politicians like to just pocket some money and let them do whatever they want. Or another explanation is ideology so that they know they could be imposing these restrictions and the Chinese would be doing it but let's just keep the economy open because we really support capitalism and let market forces do their job. Or capacity where the government knows they could be asking for more but they don't have trained or skilled negotiators that can face sort of the Chinese negotiators that have more experience. But I would like to bring up a new explanation here, which is the government's perceptions on their own bargaining power matter. And why could this be one of the explanations? I mean, it isn't exactly obvious that these economies do have bargaining power, right? Like we just talked about all the weaknesses and how the Washington Consensus and the Poverty Trap Narrative really suggests that these countries are negotiating from a position of weakness. So I conducted interviews, especially very, very intensively in Nigeria, to understand how the Nigerian government thinks about Chinese companies and how Chinese companies think about the Nigerian government in terms of kind of policy sensitivity and exit thresholds and of what would be the policies that would drive the Chinese out. And the Nigerian government I interviewed national ministers who told me honestly, we have no bargaining power here. The Chinese and the West, they're bringing all the money and we have nothing to offer. So we kind of just have let them do whatever they want to, versus with the Chinese companies, as I said, I got a lot of them just said, you know, I would do everything to be able to stay here. And in other countries like Tanzania, there was much more of this awareness, this China really needs us. And then Ethiopia I've heard that a lot like we are really pulling the Chinese in here right now because we have cheap labor and we have cheap land. And this is exactly what China is looking for right now. So what are the factors that influence African governments' perceptions on bargaining power? And I tried to understand the political economy behind this. So first of all, I think the historic relationship to the West versus the East matters to where I said, Nigeria was a British colony for a very long time. And we went through the Washington Consensus and really adapted what Western investors were telling Nigeria at that time, versus Ethiopia had never been colonized. Tanzania also has a very long historical relationship with China. They've looked very much more towards the East also during the Cold War. There is also federalism and ministry constellation where in Nigeria, a lot of different states, they actually compete for investments. So they're not likely to share information, how much Chinese investment is actually coming in. And a lot of them really underestimated Nigeria's position and attractiveness to China. And it's the same with ministry constellation, where in Nigeria you have a lot of ministries sort of competing for these deals, and there's not one collaborative effort versus when you have one sort of very centralized government. That government has all the information on sort of what investment comes in. And it's also overtime learning if you have one party in power for a long time, they might have tested out kind of what can we asked for also more informal deals. And then finally individual agency also matters, where I've just met people, for example in Tanzania, someone in a very senior position in the ministry. He was educated in Japan, and just really studied industrial policy through and through. And he just knew, he was very confident that China was going to obey by these rules if Tanzania asked for them. And Tanzania also has similar policies to Ethiopia. So what are some policy implications here? I just think incentives are more effective than requirements. Mostly because when you look at these different graphs from the West and China, you're trying to attract two different kinds and types of investors. So if you offer like a menu like Ethiopia has here, different types of investors can pick whatever they like the most. So if I care more about low taxes, maybe I'm more willing to have a joint venture and so forth. So you can kind of mix up different policies and offer a different menu to different types of investors that can pick whatever they wanna do. I think because these countries also have weak formal policies, it leaves room for a case-by-case negotiations as we see, for example, with these industrial parks that I talked about. The hidden industrial parks of the villages that kind of set up a deal that work for all sides. And you should also account for enter and exit thresholds where I think the decision of companies to enter your country, are probably, they're more sensitive to kind of your policy environment rather than if you're already in the country. And then certainly, you have to pay higher taxes. So your decision to exit because you already set up kind of a factory, et cetera. It's gonna be less sensitive than if you still need to put in all the capital in the beginning. So what are some expectations for the future? So I think there's certain things to consider on the Chinese side. Which is can China maintain its growth but I also heard that because China's growth is slowing now all these Chinese manufacturers are moving to Africa in search for new opportunities, and they feel like the African region is the next one to industrialize. So it's kind of, literature here is not clear whether China slowing its growth, is actually good or bad for the African region. How its rivalry will play out with the US. And what about automation and the flying geese. So I think that's something we should be concerned about that if labor is being replaced with machines, maybe the cheap labor in Africa is gonna be less needed. So factors on the African side, I think the biggest question is, can countries start to use their bargaining power and negotiate stronger deals? And just coming up with a strategy, I think here is essential, rather than just leaving the entire economy open and letting investors do whatever they want. Sort of what China did when it was poor and agricultural. It did come up with a strategy that propelled up the economy. And I think this is interesting on debts and trade, because as I said, at the former China-Africa cooperation in 2008, African countries already complained that there was an in trade imbalance between China and Africa and that China should also import more from the African region. So it seems like around debts and trade, there is more of an awareness that this relationship should be more equal. And I hope that investments also are going into the right direction. So just to close, I brought you this comparison here again, which shows very nicely, China's economic growth miracle. And what I find really interesting here is that in the '80s, it was really the West investing in China and doing a lot of trade with China, but we still don't call it the West in China, how we call China in Africa today. And this is because China took some lessons from other countries in the past, like some of the structural adjustment, it's liked and implemented others, it came up with the zones model, which was the state capitalism. And I think similarly, the African region also can just copy and paste one model from China now or from the West, but it should strategize and see sort of what fits to local realities and the common narrative here has always been that the African region can't afford to strategize because otherwise you can't really attract foreign investment to grow. But I think because Africa is the region that has the highest stocks of raw material in the world, the cheapest labor right now and the cheapest land, I do think that there's some leverage here for the African region. And hopefully in the future, we can recolor this map and the African region can catch up with China. Thank you. 
Now a third school also developed around this time and this, as we see on slide 13, is the Functionalism School or the Functionalists. There are several major players. They include people like James, Hall, Cattell, and Angel. They also developed as a reaction to the Structuralists and were basically a United States phenomenon. As we see in slide 14, the Functionalists weren’t really concerned with the elementary elements of consciousness. They were more concerned with how the mind works. What mediated between the external world and the internal events that were located inside the body? That is, what is the function of things? What is the function of the cortex, the hypocampus, the hypothalamus, and on and on and on. In addition to that, from a little less physiological measure, how does an organism adapt and survive? What are the things that allow an organism to adapt within its environment? That is, what is the function of certain things, such as your thumb or a big toe or whatever it may be. As a result, the functionalists examined both humans and animals to try to determine what the function of some particular thing was. And as we see in slide 15, the key for the Functionalists is, “What is the function of some behavior?” We could take an example of that. What is the function of love? So the importance is not on the components that make up the behavior, but what is the function of that particular behavior. What is the function of doing something? As a result, they studied real life events and ultimately they allowed psychology to be applied into industry, education, medicine and many other areas, and that is where it’s primarily used today. 
In the last sections we have examined a wide variety of aspects related to classical and operant, and instrumental conditioning. In this section we begin talking about the last major and the current model of learning that is pretty much used by a lot of people today. These are called cognitive models. So, let’s begin by looking at some of the theorists of cognition which is shown on slide two. As you can see, a lot of the theorists of cognitive psychology relate all the way back to Plato. They include people like Tollman, Hull, and a variety of other people such as Anderson. In the last sections that we’ve talked about within instrumental and operant conditioning, we talked about some kind of stimulus causing some kind of response. And then following the response by some consequent stimulus. It depended upon the particular approach that one took whether one focused on the initial stimuli or the consequent stimuli following a response. In cognitive models, what is focused on is not the consequent stimulus or the initial stimulus, but what is going on inside the organism. We will talk about and label that stimulus with an O. So, what goes on inside the organism is the most important thing for cognitive theorists. So what kind of internal variables are investigated with different cognitive models of learning. These are listed on slide four. (For example, locus of control, expectancy, etc. ). So, let’s look at some of these variables a little more closely
The next major aspect that we look at when we examine internal events relate to what are called traits. The classic person who’s looked at traits is Allport . Allport defines three different major traits that we have. So lets examine these for a minute. Cardinal traits for Allport (as we see in slide 15) are traits that dominate an individual’s life. That is, your passion to serve others, to acquire wealth, or whatever they are. It’s basically things that dominate your life and makes you behave the way you are. The second type of trait is what we call central traits. These are shown in slide 16. These are descriptive traits that you would use to describe someone. Are they nice, do they dress well, etc. And finally, we have what are called secondary traits. That is, these are traits that are not obvious, that show up in particular situations. For example, aggressiveness with an individual who’s pretty mellow and cool but when they get to a baseball or a basketball game, they turn into a total monster. These are traits that are not normally obvious to an individual, but show up in particular situations. So in general when we look at cognitive psychology and cognitive learning, what we look at are internal events that are out there. And basically these internal events are all examined within cognitive models. Again within a cognitive model, the focus is on things inside the organism. that is, the mind. And as a consequence of that, the models are much harder to measure than some kind of objective behavior that’s usually discussed by Skinner and others. So in general what we see here is that we have a variety of different things that relates to cognitive models of learning. In the next section, we will continue on with this discussion, so until then have yourself a great day.
