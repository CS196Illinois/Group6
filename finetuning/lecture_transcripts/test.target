Then we examined some different brain structures that were involved in memory. In the two previous sections, we looked at early theories of memory (stage or multiprocess theories). In essence, depth of processing models rely on a computer model of memory. In this section we begin a discussion of the second major memory model called depth of processing models. In the last couple of sections we have been examining a variety of different memory aspects. Depth of processing models take a different approach than stage theory. In sensory memory, what we have is some kind of sensory memory going in the short term memory and then in the long term memory. However, the major difference is the way people view how the memory storage process occurs. So what is shallow processing?In many ways it’s similar to stage theory. Depth of processing looks at shallow versus deep processing. Red also triggers similar concepts of ambulance. When we want to retrieve the data, the hard drive material is moved to random access memory, and then we can do something with it. In general, we have talked about depth of processing models. As we see in slide two, there are many different types of theorists associeated with these models, but the two key papers are by Craik and Lockhart and Craik and Tulving. 
These storage systems are sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Within declarative memory, there are smaller categories of memory, or subdivisions—episodic memory and semantic memory. The main two categories of long-term memory are declarative memory and procedural memory. The most influential theory is that memory works as a kind of storage system, or storehouse, for information. Sensory memory holds information for the shortest amount of time—less than four seconds. It is not entirely clear how some sensory memories transfer into more meaningful short-term memories. Some experts believe that sensory information changes into visual images as it is stored, and others believe that information changes into words. Short-term memory, which is also sometimes called “working memory,” holds information for about 15 to 25 seconds. Long-term memory holds information almost indefinitely, although retrieving it can sometimes be difficult. According to this theory, there are three types of these storage systems with different functions that hold information for different amounts of time. We forget sensory memories almost instantly, unless they pass into another storage system. Psychologists have many theories to explain how we remember information. Procedural memory is where we store memory of skills and habits, like how to ride a bike or how to boil an egg. Long-term memory has several different components, or modules, that correspond to separate memory systems in the brain. Sensory memory is where stimuli, or things that stimulate our senses, are very briefly stored. Semantic memory is where we organize general knowledge or facts about the world, such as math formulas, spelling rules, and capital cities. Declarative memory is where we store factual information, such as names, faces, dates, life events. Think of long-term memory as a very big library, or even a computer chip, with almost unlimited capacities for storage. However, it has been proven that memory going into this system is made up of “chunks,” or groups, of meaningful information (for example, single letters or numbers or more complicated sets of information), and that only around seven “chunks” of information can be stored in short-term memory. Examples of the type of information that typically goes into short-term memory are telephone numbers, addresses, and names. 
The instructors for this class are Rohan Suresh and Sami Alqadi. The goals for today are to go over class logistics, go over what is Bash and what we will do with it, and understand Bash setup for different operating systems. Communication is through Piazza and Discord. Bash is a text only interface which can be used for controlling unix based operating system. Bash is a standardized way of interacting with the operating systems and its programs and standardization allows for easy automation/manipulation of many different tasks. There is virtually no setup for Linux or Mac, but for Windows one must install an Ubuntu Shell. Commands are unique statements that indicate specific tasks. Some commands need arguments which are further variables we provide to commands to execute a task. Flags are used to initialize commands behaviors. ls is used to list all files in the current directory, and the flag -a is used to list ALL files, including hidden ones. pwd is used to print the working directory. cd will let you change directory. Using cd and then starting the path with / will use an absolute path and cd . . will let you move up a directory. cat is used to display the contents of a file. touch is used to create a file in the current directory. rm is used to PERMANENTLY delete a file, and using the flag -rf with delete a file and its underlying components. BE CAREFUL WITH THIS. mkdir is used to create an empty directory. rmdir is used to delete an empty directory. mv is used to rename a file and/or move the file to a new location. cp will copy a file to a new location. man is used to bring up the manual for a command. Piping into files allows you to redirect output from the command line: > is used to redirect output, >> is used to append output to the file. 
People came to the Americas via the Bering Strait ice bridge. Native American societal structure is built upon interactions with each other and the environment. Natives practiced animism, which is the belief that non-human things possess a spiritual essence. Natives developed societies that transformed and adapted to their diverse environments. Some examples include the Pueblo, Lakota Sioux, and Iroquois. The colonization of the New World centered around the 3 Gs: gold, glory, and god. The arrival of Columbus led to massive demographic and social changes. The Columbian exchange caused the trans-atlantic exchange of people, diseases, food, trade, ideas, etc between the Western Hemisphere, Africa, and Europe. Horses, disease, and corn were all exchanged. The Treaty of Tordesillas made Spain and Portugal divide up the Western Hemisphere. The Encomienda System said Spanish colonists received land with native people. They used native slave labor in mining or agriculture. Spanish people sought to convert Native people to Catholicism. Mestizos are people of mixed Indian and European heritage. Mulattos are people of mixed white and black ancestry. PopeÕs Rebellion in 1680 led to the death of hundreds of Spanish colonists and the destruction of Catholic churches in the area. Debates occurred over how Native Americans should be treated. Juan de Sepulvida wrote ÒJust Causes for War Against the IndiansÓ that justified Spanish colonization of the Americas. Bartolome de las Casas published in 1552 ÒA Short Account of the Destruction of the IndiesÓ that criticized Spanish treatment of indigenous people. Protestant England will soon challenge Spanish colonization of North America. The Spanish, French, and Dutch are going to attempt to exploit new world resources AND form more complex relationships with indigenous people. A reason for colonization is mercantilism, which is when colonies exist to enrich the Mother country. These countries have access to raw materials and provide gold and silver. 
In the election of 1840, the Whigs chose William Henry Harrison as a President and John Tyler as Vice President. Tyler still holds many Democrat beliefs, and he starts to block goals of the Whig party, led by Henry Clay and Daniel Webster. He attempts to annex Texas, but he is defeated by Congress. In the Election of 1844, James K. Polk wins. During the lame duck period, John Tyler submitted a proposal and Congress annexed Texas. This was accomplished by a joint resolution, as it only needed a majority of both houses. It does not need a 2/3 approval by the Senate. The goals of James K. Polk were to lower the tariff, exploit national expansion and use manifest destiny, expand into Oregon, annex Texas, and acquire California. Manifest Destiny was the belief that it was AmericaÕs destiny to conquer and civilize the entire continent. It was built upon the belief of white superiority. The term was coined by John OÕSullivan in 1845. Western expansion had been going on for some time, as displayed by the Lousiana Purchase in 1803, the Missouri Compromise in 1820, and JacksonÕs Indian Removal policies in the 1830s. The issue of slavery complicates the issue of western expansion. The Oregon Dispute, known as the 54Õ 40 or Fight!, was rooted in the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, where the U. S. and England agreed to peacefully jointly occupy the Oregon Territory. The Oregon Trail saw many American settlers flood into the area. There was a major issue in the Election of 1844. The Oregon Treaty in 1846 did not cause war. Mexico still viewed Texas as part of Mexico. This caused a dispute over the river Rio Grande and Nueces river. Polk attempts to buy California from Mexico. The Slidell Mission was when Mexico refuses offer of 25 million dollars for California. Polk sends Zachary Taylor into disputed territory between Mexico and Texas. U. S. forces attacked in April 1846. The Northern Whigs oppose the war, as they see it as an attempt by Southerners to extend slavery. Lincoln introduces the ÒSpot ResolutionÓ, demanding to know if attack really took place on U. S. soil. The Wilmot Proviso attempted to ban slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico. This was passed by the House but rejected by the Senate. In the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo in 1848, Mexico gave up claims to Texas and accepts Rio Grande border. Mexico gave the U. S. , California, New Mexico, and the rest of the Southwest. This increases U. S. territory by 1/3. Mexico lost about half its territory. This strains relations between the U. S. and Mexico. 
The first central question is, is China a new colonialist? Or is this presence adding to local development on the ground in Africa? And are the final colonialists here by a foreign power that tries to take partial or complete political control over another nation, as well as engages in economic exploitation? Then the second central question is how does China's presence add to institutional development? So sort of more on the political side. So the question is, why do some countries like Nigeria, Kenya, negotiate weaker deals in the sense of like, diversification issues and local participation, weaker deals with China than others like Ethiopia and Tanzania? Ther are some common explanations here, for example corruption that countries know that they could be asking for more from the Chinese investors, but they aren't because politicians like to just pocket some money and let them do whatever they want. 
The third school that developed is the Functionalism School. The major players were James, Hall, Cattell, and Angel. Functionalists were concerned with how the mind works. They examined humans and animals to determine the function of some particular thing. They allowed psychology to be applied in other areas today. 
We will be talking about the last major and the current model of learning that many people use today called cognitive models. The theorists of cognitive psychology, like Tollman, Hull, and Anderson, relate all the way back to Plato. Cognitive models focus on what is going on inside the organism. There are four variables investigated with cognitive models of learning. 
Allport defines the three major traits we have are the things that dominate your life and make you behave the way you are. Again, within a cognitive model, the focus is on things inside the organism.
