The third school that developed is the Functionalism School. The major players were James, Hall, Cattell, and Angel. Functionalists were concerned with how the mind works. They examined humans and animals to determine the function of some particular thing. They allowed psychology to be applied in other areas today. 
We will be talking about the last major and the current model of learning that many people use today called cognitive models. The theorists of cognitive psychology, like Tollman, Hull, and Anderson, relate all the way back to Plato. Cognitive models focus on what is going on inside the organism. There are four variables investigated with cognitive models of learning. 
Allport defines the three major traits we have are the things that dominate your life and make you behave the way you are. Again, within a cognitive model, the focus is on things inside the organism.
