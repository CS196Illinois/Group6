But what are the limits of using DNA as a tool in forensic science? To address this question we need to learn the basic structure of DNA and the rules of inheritance. Let’s start by simply defining a few terms, and we’ll start with the term heredity. Heredity can simply be defined as the passing of traits to offspring. We can think about this in 2 time scales—a short time scale over just 1 generation or a long time scale involving ancestors that go back millennia. Another term that we should define is phenotype. A measurable trait of an organism is often referred to as a phenotype. Here we list examples under different categories like disease or behavioral phenotypes. We can classify phenotypes into 2 types of traits: simple inherited traits and complex inherited traits.Traits of simple inheritance have the following characteristics: They are monogenic or controlled by only 1 gene. They are binary or discontinuous. And the expression of these traits is not greatly influenced by the environment. Simple inherited traits represent only a small fraction of all human traits.\"\n","\n","\n","# 1.
